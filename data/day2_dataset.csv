Knox- ville: University of Tennessee Press, 1995. xlvii + 283 pp. (Cloth US$ 35.00) Michael Mullin Department of History California State University Sacramento CA 95819, U.S.A. This provocative collection is comprised of papers that were originally presented to a 1993 conference at the University of Munich. The fourteen essays, principally by anthropologists and historians, cover a variety of topics such as Frederick Douglass, slaveowning native Americans, Suri- name Maroons, and West African market women. As is usual in enterprises of this kind, the contributions are uneven. A few represent elephants giving birth to mice, and the range is from thought pieces on the secondary literature (Sidney Mintz) to substantial investigations based on extensive archival research (of which the essays by Karen Fog Olwig, Gert Oostindie and Alex van Stipriaan, H.U.E. Thoden van Velzen, and Jean Besson, concerning slave and maroon cultures in the Danish West Indies, Suriname, and Jamaica are recommended.) The whole is graced by Stephan Palmié' s introduction, which is am- bitious, provides a broad historiographical context, and in places is use- fully controversial regarding the present state of early African American history. Herein, and on the dust jacket, we are assured that slave resistance is the focus of many of the contributions. But whether the issue is the con- stricting character of the resistance/accommodation approach (certainly a strawman by now), slave religion, the internal economy, or family life generally, the great problem in the field remains that of the nature and extent of Old World patterns as they shaped the Africans' adaptations to slavery, and how the same combined with local circumstances - terrain, demography, production modes - to shape the beginnings of African American cultures and communities. Until we get this seminal problem right, including the key issue of the nomenclature contemporaries actually used to describe the ways of incoming Africans, the chances of confound- ing rather than illuminating matters remains significant. West Africans were"", '136 New West Indian Guide/Nieuwe West Indische Gids vol. 72 no. 1 & 2 (1998) polygynous, for instance, and brought those expectations with them, as they did much of the spirituality which pervaded other modalities of their existence. In lifting the lid on the Chinese box of cultural survivals, Palmié scores the theoretical suppositions of Melville J. Herskovits as ""naive"" (p. xix), while praising another scholar for ""discarding much of an older analytical vocabulary involving concepts such as \'culture contact\' or \'accultura- tion,\' and substituting the fashionable notion of \'cultural conversations\'"" (p. xx-xxi). Accordingly, precedence is given to the by-now familiar arguments that incoming Africans were ""mere collectivities of deracinated individuals"" (p. xvii-xx, xxiii) (encapsulated in Mintz and Price\'s influ- ential The Birth of African-American Culture ), and to the complementary view, in Genovese\' s ""magisterial"" work, that the slaves\' introjected their owners\' paternalistic outlook. These positions don\'t hold up well in light of what is now available in the literature concerning the role played by African cultural carryovers (which in certain times and places may be attributed - as they were by contemporaries black and white - to specific West African nationalities); nor are they corroborated by descriptions in this collection of repatriated slaves (Richard Rathbone, pp. 57, 62-63), slave cults derivative of Africa (Oostindie & Van Stipriaan, p. 93), and actual code words contemporaries used to denote those among their slaves who were African (Gudrun Meier, p. 71). This is a useful volume, particularly because several of its contributors have been willing to take on the more difficult comparative and theoretical issues which continue to animate discussions of early African American history.']",603,391,1,"[-0.025967828929424286, -0.010421032086014748, 0.019404681399464607, -0.03051050379872322, -0.008129354566335678, 0.013058495707809925,

http://www.jstor.org/stable/2378145,Review Article,"['Isabel Eaton', 'Thomas Nelson Page']","['5i8 International Journal of Ethics. THE NEGRO.: The Southerner\'s Problem. By Thomas Nelson Page. New York: Charles Scribner\'s Sons, November, I904. Pp. xii, 3I5. In his latest book Mr. Page\'s views upon the Negro are de- livered with all the grace characteristic of his previous writings; but in a book on so serious a subject we shall not dwell upon literary style, but, as seerts more fit, upon the author\'s point of view and his main arguments deduced from observation and statistics. First, as to point of view, the spirit in which Mr. Page has penned his preface is such as to disarm hostile criticism, and to lead the reviewer to emulate the author\'s endeavor to be ""plain, candid, and as far as possible, temperate,"" to ""tell the truth absolutely as he sees it,"" and thus ""do his part to help others find it."" The sincerity of the author\'s desire cannot be questioned, but whether he has given a candid and impartial statement of the case let the reader judge. Mr. Page endeavors to show (i) that the Negro Problem is the Southerner\'s problem, and does not concern the North; (2) that a race can be judged fairly by its rank and file plus its criminals and paupers, but minus its genius and virtue; (3) that the Negro is essentially inferior; has always been a slave and always will be; that he is not improvable and has accomplished nothing noteworthy. Let us consider these points separately. i. Mr. Page\'s title claims the Negro problem as ""the Southern- er\'s Problem,"" but in view of the fact (cited in the early chapters) that both North and South were instrumental in bringing Negro slaves to America, and that North as well as South has helped to create the present situation, we hold the question to be a national one. Further, ""it is a national problem in the sense that North and South are parties in interest,"" says Dr. Felix Adler, ""and that being the case, it is, of course, our right as well as our duty to be heard; for whatever is done in the South is going to affect us in the North; if the solution is right it will help us; if wrong it will hurt us-more than that, it will hurt the Republic."" Must we not agree that both North and South as parties in interest must contribute to the solution of the prob- lem? Is it not true that all Americans, black as well as white, must contribute labor and insight, thought and devotion, to the solution? Who, save General Armstrong himself, has done more towards its peaceful solution than the man who is known through-', 'Book Reviews. 5I9 out the civilized world as ""the Negro Moses""? There can be little doubt that the intelligent men among the Negroes them- selves will do incalculably more than any other class or race toward the solution of the problem. For these reasons we hold that the problem is not for the Southern white man alone, but for the Northern white man also, and for the Negro American, North and South. The question, ""What shall we (Southern white men) do with the Negro ?"" should be changed to ""What can the Negro be encouraged by both North and South to accomplish through his own efforts?"" It is a national problem, not the Southerner\'s alone. 2. Again, Mr. Page entitles his book ""The Negro,"" but expli- citly states that ""when the writer speaks of the Negroes he desires generally to be understood as referring to the great body of the race, and not as including what may be termed the upper fraction -that is, those who, by reason of intellect, education and char- acter, form so clearly an exception that they must be considered as ,a separate class"" (page 62), and in the preface: ""In characterizing -the Negroes generally, it is not meant to include the respectable element among them, except where this is plainly intended."" We may be mistaken, but we believe that no American or Englishman would agree that any book upon the Anglo-Saxon which should omit Shakespeare, Browning, Emerson, Gladstone, Washington, Lincoln (and the rest who go to make up the Anglo-Saxon ""upper fraction"") and should judge us by our clerks, farmers, grocerymen, and our criminals could lay claim to be entitled ""The Anglo- Saxon."" In other words we hold that a race, like an individual, must be judged by all its fruits. In any fair judgment of a man\'s character his virtues must appear. We should object to having our character or our literature judged with the best excluded, but Mr. Page elects to judge the Negro race without considering Frederick Douglass, Booker Washington, Professor DuBois, or -the other leading men. 3. Mr. Page holds that the Negro is essentially inferior; that he has always been a slave or menial and always will be. He argues at length to this effect (page 248, et seq.): ""The earliest human records . . . the monuments of Egypt show him as a slave bearing burdens; after tens of centuries he is still a menial. Four thousand years have not served to whiten the pigments of the frame nor developed the force of the intellect. The leopard cannot change his spots to-day nor the Ethiopian his skin, any', '520 International Journal of Ethics. more than in the days of Jeremiah. It is not argued that because the Negro is a Negro he is incapable of any intellectual develop- inent. On the contrary under certain conditions of intellectual environment, careful training, sympathetic encouragement from the stronger races, he may individually attain a fair degree of mental development. . . . Where the Negro has thriven it has invariably been under the influence and by the assistance of the stronger races. Where these have been wanting, whatever other conditions have existed, he has invariably reverted toward the original (barbaric) type. Civilization has swept triumphant over a large part of the earth; only in Negro-Africa has barbarism held unbroken rule and savagery maintained perpetual domain. No faintest gleam has ever pierced the impenetrable gloom of the \'Dark Continent.\' . . . But suppose that other observers may have found a well-to-do doctor or lawyer . . . it only proves that in individual instances they may rise to a fair level; it simply em- phasises the fact that these are exceptions and does not in the least affect the argument, which is, that the Negroes, as a race, have never exhibited much capacity to advance, that as a race they arc ihifcrior to other races."" The argument is that the Negro, because he belongs to the Negro race, does not advance, which is a direct contradiction of the statement quoted above that ""it is not argued that the Negro because he is a Negro is incapable of intellectual development."" Many other citations might be made of statements which similarly cannot bear analysis, but to give one only,-a particularly glaring self-contradiction, because the two statements occur within eight lines of each other,-on page 54 Mr. Page says, ""A visit to the South will show any one that in the main the feeling of kindness and good will (existing between the Southern whites and their former slaves) has survived all the haranguing of the politician and all the teaching of the doctrinaire."" Eight lines down he says, ""The rule is a changed relation and a widening breach."" (Italics ours.) Such contradictions would discredit the arguments of any writer, North or South. Moreover, the main contentions of the above passage are not borne out by the facts: the Negro, without assistance, does not ""in- variably revert"" to barbarism, nor has barbarism and savagery held unbroken sway in Negro-Africa. Mr. Page cannot have heard of the interesting work of distinguished German and other ethnologists who have devoted several years to the investigation', 'Book Reviews. 52I of Negro race-history in Africa, with most encouraging results. Dr. Franz Boas, the distinguished ethnologist of the New York Museum of Natural History, is authority for the statement that ""The Negro all over the African continent is either a tiller of the soil or the owner of large herds. . . . Arts and industries have de- veloped to a great extent. . . . We may safely say, that at a time when our own ancestors still used stone implements or at best when bronze weapons were first introduced, the Negro had de- veloped the art of smelting iron; it seems likely that their race has contributed more than any other to the early development of the iron industry. . . . The legal trend of mind of the people deserves especial mention. . . . Local trade is highly developed in all parts of Africa. . . . A relatively high degree of culture has been attained throughout the Sudan where the true Negro, the ancestor of our slave population, has achieved the very ad- vances which the critics of the Negro would have us believe he cannot attain. He has a highly developed agriculture, and the industries connected with his daily life are complex and artistic. His power of organization has been such that for centuries large empires have existed which have proved their stability in wars with their neighbors, and which have left their records in the chronicles. . . . Barth, the discoverer of the chronicles, who knew the Sudanese Negro through long and intimate intercourse, says, ""King Askia, perhaps the greatest sovereign that ever ruled over Negroland, was a native of the country. The dynasty of the Askia was entirely of native descent. . . . It is of no \'small interest to a person who endeavors to take a comprehensive view of the various races of mankind, to observe how a Negro king in the in- terior of the continent not only extended his conquests far and wide, but also governed his subjects with justice and equity, caus- ing well-being and comfort to spring up everywhere within the borders of his extensive dominions, and introducing such of the in- stitutions of Mohammedan civilization as he considered might be useful to his subjects."" Finally Dr. Boas concludes that, ""The achievements of the Negro in Africa justify us in maintaining that the race is capable of social and political achievements; that it will produce here, as it has done in Africa, its great men; and that it will contribute its part to the welfare of the community."" This should convince Mr. Page that his statements about rever- sion to barbarism and about the unbroken savagery of the Dark Continent are based on insufficient information, as is also his', '.522 International Journal of Ethics. declaration that ""nothing of value to the human race"" has yet been produced-in art, in mechanical development, in literature, in science-by the Negro mind, or he perhaps forgets the paintings by Tanner, which have been exhibited ""on the line"" in Parisian galleries, the poems and charming southern stories of Paul Dun- bar, the ""lyric prose"" of Professor DuBois, the writings of Alex- andre Dumas, the patent brake device of a Negro which is in present use on the elevated roads of New York-one of numer- -ous inventions by the same man-or the personal power and eloquence, the educational and administrative achievement of Mr. Booker Washington, just to mention a few things which come at once to mind. Also we think most people will agree with us in thinking that building, carpentry and similar skilled work is pro- duced at least partly by mind and it is assuredly of value to the human race. In view of these facts we must conclude that Mr. Page fails to live up to the aspirations of his preface. We do not doubt his wish to deal candidly with his subject, but we are forced to the conclu- sion that he lacks the unbiased mind which would enable him to do so. His statements are too sweeping and are not supported in all cases by the actual facts, as has, we believe, been shown. All this does not make Mr. Page\'s stories less delightful, but there can be no question that it completely discredits his book on ""The Negro"" and rules it out of the class of books which can be considered to contribute anything of value to the discussion of the Negro Problem.

Her ""black rice thesis"" was devel oped from other scholars\' prior suggestions that West African slaves rather than European masters and overseers were to be credited for the successful development of rice plantations in the South Carolina low country. Carney drew on her strengths a geographer to argue how people forced to migrate from a specific region in West Africa to early America had managed, despite their bondage, to transfer an entire cultural system that included seeds, skills, and smarts. Carney writes here with her husband, Rich Rosomoff, an independent author and veteran co-traveler on her research trips. In the Shadow of Slavery reads as a broad application of the Black Rice argument to other plants as well as animals that could be used for food, and to places beyond the much-debated Upper Guinea-South Carolina nexus. But where the ear lier book explained the development of rice as a North American cash crop, what is instead emphasized here is the significance of subsistence farming, first in tropical Africa and then in the New World. Carney and Rosomoff argue strongly that focusing on subsistence is needed to correct the ""stan dard emphasis on commodities"" (pp. 4-5)—which was, it must be said, in part created by the success of Black Rice. They celebrate Africans\' and then African Americans\' achievements in creating food security for themselves by themselves. To do so, they first describe the dynamism of African foodways in the millennia before Columbus\'s ocean crossings. In the deep past, Africans domesticated indigenous crops and animals before turning their attention to new alternatives originated from neighboring continents. Stressed is the sophistication of Africans, but ironically their bounty turned Africa into a breadbasket providing the provisions needed to sustain the fragile eco nomics of the Middle Passage. Carney and Rosomoff argue, against a back ground of scarce evidence, that Africans liberated remaining stores from slave ships as they disembarked and entered American slaveries.

I .a llcur', 'Book Reviews 137 smuggled samples of reproductive parts of African cultigens equipped Afri can slaves and their descendants with the ability to recreate some aspects of their former lives of working, cooking, and eating. Throughout, the authors synthesize a wide range of primary sources (especially those available in English) and scholarly secondary literature. Their sources for Africa tend toward gold-standard texts from the scholarly secondary literature of the 1970s, but also informed by judiciously selected research published in the last decade, none of it controversial. These con servative choices are likely to give longevity to the text\'s usefulness. The highly readable prose—forgiving some repetitions and occasional novelistic flair—makes complicated issues accessible for those unfamiliar with the scholarly issues, and the text includes abundant illustrations from Atlantic-era books to engage non-specialists. Thus this book will find great utility for readers of the NWIG in any college-level topics courses they teach, for which they might assign the entire volume or select a relevant chapter or two. The recent release as an affordable paperback will help instructors adopt the text. (Puzzling is the high expense of the electronic version.) Like Black Rice, this book has garnered acclaim, including a shared win of the 2010 Frederick Douglass Book Prize from Yale University\'s Gilder Lehrman Center for the best book written in English on slavery or aboli tion. Historians who raised questions about Black Rice will search the pages of In the Shadow of Slavery in vain for indications that they have been engaged (see, for example, Eltis, Morgan & Richardson 2007,2010). But they are probably not the intended audience. Instead, Carney and Rosomoff are clear (p. 1) that they are addressing a ""popular image"" of Africa as a hungry continent and ""perceptions of a continent populated by hapless farmers and herders in need of European instruction."" These are old, but regret tably durable conceptualizations created and recreated by those outside of Africa in identifiable historical contexts (including the sort of Western lib eralism that still brings some students into our courses because they want to ""help save Africa""). Readers of the NWIG who wish to engage In the Shadow of Slavery as an intellectual project are recommended to read Carney\'s contemporary essay on geography as a research methodology (2010). It explains that geog raphers use the same sources as historians, anthropologists, or archaeolo gists, but can make distinctive ""reasonable inferences"" from gaps in the record, in ways that the others cannot. If geography, as defined by Camey,', '138 Book Reviews cannot provide us with new information by way of new sources, it can prompt scholars to ask new questions that cannot yet be answered by data in the historical or archaeological records. Historians, linguistics, botanists, geneticists, archaeologists and others must do the spadework. So Carney and Rosomofif should be praised for the questions they raise and for showing scholars some of the unanswered questions about the rela tionship between the environmental and cultural histories of Africans in the diaspora. They offer some new questions and answer many of these with new arguments, while simultaneously pushing the temporal boundar ies of what humanistic geographers can pursue. J.D.

http://www.jstor.org/stable/20024210,Black History Unbound,['Benjamin Quarles'],"['BENJAMIN QUARLES Black History Unbound Until recent times the role of the Afro-American in our national life was thought to be hardly worth considering. An intellectual ""white flight"" held sway; most writers in the social sciences and the humanities, whatever their individual specialties, assumed that they knew as much about blacks as they needed to know or as their readers cared to learn. With this static image, the black was considered something of an intruder, if not indeed an outsider. In many quarters he was regarded as an exotic, an offshoot, hardly ""a peece of the Continent, a part of the maine."" Certainly he was underplayed in American history and letters. This situation has undergone considerable change in the past two decades. The stepped-up civil rights movement following the Supreme Court\'s public school desegregation decision in 1954 heightened black consciousness and sparked the de mand for black power, thereby creating a larger audience for black expression in its various forms. The popularization of black history in the mass-circulation monthly, Ebony, particularly in the writings of its senior editor, Lerone Bennett, Jr., left a deep imprint on hundreds of thousands of readers hitherto unresponsive to the call of the past. Of considerable influence, too, in raising the level of black con sciousness was the emergence of more than a score of black nations below the Sahara, whose newly acquired independence was at once a symbol and a reminder of a rich precolonial African heritage too long in limbo. The colleges and universities have assumed a major role in this contemporary example of the present recreating the past. In predominantly white colleges, the proliferation of black studies owes much to pressures from black students, often supported by fellow students and faculty. The marked increase in the number of blacks attending these colleges in the sixties, combined with their search for per sonal identity and group solidarity, led to their demand for courses relating to the black experience, a demand often heading the list designated as "" non-negotiable/\' Black colleges had long operated precursor programs in black studies, but in the sixties they considerably increased their offerings. Although such black-oriented programs, quite unlike other college offerings, made their way into the curriculum as a result of student pressures, the colleges soon realized that the newly introduced disciplines were worthy of inclusion. Black history might well have healing in its wings, but it also had an intrinsic importance much broader than its therapeutic value. Black studies, despite their tender years, can no longer be regarded as a con troversial academic innovation, though coming-of-age ceremonies would certainly be premature at this ""growing pains"" stage. It is impossible for American society to 163', '164 BENJAMIN QUARLES be properly appraised if blacks are left out of the picture. ""We cannot,"" writes Columbia historian Walter Metzger, ""understand America without the help of those studies now called * black/ "" John W. Blassingame of Yale concurs, pointing out that ""no American can truly understand his own society and culture without a knowledge of the roles Negroes have played in them."" The black looms large in American letters, writes Jean Fagan Yellin: ""His dark figure is ubiquitous in our fic tion; the American imagination was as obsessed in the nineteenth century by the black as it is today."" Since Jamestown, black-white relationships have been a cen tral attribute of our national culture. The experiences of blacks and whites, though profoundly different, have always been intertwined and complementary, even sym biotic on occasion, however much whites may have monopolized the process and substance of power. Hence American studies, properly perceived, must be viewed through a multiracial lens. The role of blacks in America?what they have done and what has been done to them?illuminates the past and informs the present. The father of black historiography, Carter G. Woodson (1875-1950), and his associates and successors have told us much about the constructive role played by blacks in the making of America. But for all his scholarship and perception, Woodson did not fully sense the dimensions of what had been done to blacks. He was, of course, familiar with the well-known U. B. Phillips contention, advanced in 1928, that the central theme in Southern history was that the South was and should remain a white man\'s coun try. But Woodson and his black-oriented contemporaries could hardly have been fully aware of the extent of racism in America, a topic which has only recently been given the type of probing scrutiny found, for example, in Winthrop D. Jordan,1 who feels that, without the blacks, the early whites would have experienced an identity crisis. As Joanna E. Schneider and Robert L. Zangrando have pointed out, one of the ways in which the American past must be reappraised is in terms of the interactions of the dominant whites with red, black and yellow peoples. ""Unless we fully comprehend the role of racism in this society, we can never truly know America,"" they observe, adding that black history ""offers us an indispensable op portunity"" to do so.2 If coming to grips with this component of our national experience confronts us with some of our more sober realities, ironies, and paradoxes, it will also revitalize inquiry. Any loss of innocence should be more than balanced by the virtues of a viewpoint more broadly humanistic in its outreach. Black literature, for example, may offer new insights into classic American literature. William W. Nichols has compared Frederick Douglass\' statements in My Bondage and My Freedom, written in 1855, with Thoreau\'s in Waiden* viewing both as seekers after freedom. Similarly, Leonard J. Deutsch, in an article entitled, ""Ralph Waldo Ellison and Ralph Waldo Emerson: A Shared Moral Vision,""4 sees points of correspondence between the two men of letters despite differences in their exteriors, not to mention in their times and manners. New awareness of the interactions of whites and blacks is making it necessary for many branches of learning to redefine themselves. Black studies, however, are more than a prelude to cross-cultural understand ing; they celebrate ethnic pluralism as a fact in our national life. More and more we are beginning to see America as a multiculture. This heightened ethnic con sciousness is not confined to color alone, but embraces non-Anglo-Saxon whites as', 'BLACK HISTORY UNBOUND 165 well. To these people not of the ""old stock,"" the idea of cultural assimilation has lost much of its appeal. In part this has stemmed from a sense of disillusionment. ""Are we living the dream our grandparents dreamed when on creaking decks they stood silent, afraid, hopeful at the sight of the Statue of Liberty,"" Michael Novak asked in 1972. ""Will we ever find that secret relief, that door, that hidden en trance?""6 But the essential feeling behind the rise of white ethnic consciousness comes not from a sense of social acceptance withheld, but rather from a realization that assimilation means ""Anglo-assimilation,"" that minority groups wishing to enter the mainstream must first divest themselves of their own values and traditions. Hence, the thrust by blacks has legitimated cultural diversity, and the push for black studies has served as a spur to studies of women, white ethnic groups, and other minorities.8 White ethnic groups, while still priding themselves on their true-blue Americanism, no longer feel that they must surrender whatever distinctive Old World ties or traits they still retain. The immigrant past is no longer considered ""fringe"" history. This polycultural concept of our country and its past, to which black studies have contributed so markedly, holds that America\'s diversity is one of her richest national endowments. It says unmistakably, if by inference, that the Northern European types were not the only ones who brought gifts to their new land. And, it might be added, this new acceptance of pluralism by no means connotes a rise in racial antagonisms. We are not unmindful of the admonition of William Dean Howells: ""Inequality is as dear to the heart of America as liberty,"" nor do we forget that many Americans, black and white, forge their identity around the con cept of color. A genuine ethnic pluralism, however, would tend less to polarize ten sion among groups than to reaffirm their mutuality. Views of Black History Although black Americans are no longer regarded as an out-group with a blank past, the field of black history is attended by ongoing problems?in the attitudes of its chroniclers, the sources available, and the changes in interpretations. In the last two decades black history has attained a growing acceptance in learned quarters. White historians could hardly escape noting such statements as those of Robert I. Rotberg that ""The existence of African history has, in recent years, achieved scholarly recognition,"" and of C. Vann Woodward that ""so far as their culture is concerned, all Americans are part Negro,"" and as a consequence, ""American history, the white man\'s version, could profit from an infusion of \'soul.\' "" If white historians still think of themselves as the custodians of the word and the gate-keepers of the citadel, they are no longer so set on viewing the Negro as a stranger, if not a barbarian at the gates. They now deal more circumspectly with blacks, hoping to avoid what logicians call the ""fallacy of initial predication."" However, although they may have succeeded in ridding themselves of preconceptions, and opening their minds to reassessing their sources, they are still subject to some nagging doubts. Many historians have a built-in skepticism con cerning innovation, particularly when it comes to a new field of inquiry or a new viewpoint about a low-status minority. The instinct for disciplinary tidiness can be especially strong in a field that is preoccupied with the past.', '166 BENJAMIN QUARLES Still gripped by the genteel tradition of the eighteenth and nineteenth cen turies, some historians almost unconsciously believe that society was and is characterized by a high culture and a low culture, and the less said about the latter the better. If a lady (Clio) had her dubious off-moments (mayhap an underworld connection or two), the well-bred and well-trained (the Ph.D.\'s) hardly care to call attention to them. And for many historians, despite all their avowed devotion to the canons of objectivity, the mystique of kith and kin still remains strong, making it difficult for them to do full justice to those they regard as beyond the pale. Ob viously, too, there are honest differences of opinion among historians; an event that one regards as a watershed may be regarded by another as little more than water under the dam. Despite assurances from recognized fellow practitioners, many white historians also believe that the whole corpus of black studies is more topical than anything else, a congeries of pressure-group accretions with very little content and a primarily political function. These guardians of the portals see black history as the current faddishness in the profession, its chief result for the discipline a decline in the quality of documentation. Some historians who acquired their basic knowledge and skills when the material available concerning blacks was indeed limited and distorted, feel that new material about blacks must also lack intellectual objectivity and fail to meet valid academic standards. The culture-bound character of their research tools enveloped them in an atmosphere which was nonblack to the extent that black issues were not discussed, and antiblack to the extent that they were. To white scholars, as to whites in general, black history is painful since it forces them to shed the notion that American society is open and fluid, a land where everyone has an equal chance for place and power. As a group, furthermore, blacks have been have-nots and, as Jesse Lemisch points out, ""The history of the powerless, the inarticulate, the poor, has not yet begun to be written because they have been treated no more fairly by historians than they have been treated by their contem poraries/\' Black chroniclers are not color blind, but they too have their blind spots. The blacks who write history are, in the main, in search of truth, the great canon of the discipline, its very elusiveness making it all the more of a challenge. The search for truth has an intrinsic value, liberating the mind and the spirit. But like many whites in the field, many black historians have ""a magnet in their mind,"" to use Herbert Butterfield\'s perceptive phrase. There is no magic in skin color, and black historians too sometimes engage in adversary proceedings, with racial vindication the paramount consideration. Black writers of history for the masses often reflect ""the great man"" theory of history, presenting a gallery of heroic men and women pushing on to victory against great odds. The black bibliographer, A. A. Schomburg, characterized these glorifiers as ""glibly trying to prove that half of the world\'s geniuses have been Negroes and to trace the pedigree of nineteenth century Americans from the Queen of Sheba."" Most writers in this school of ""Claim-the-World Negro History"" were not as able as J. A. Rogers, the black biographer who died in 1966. That Rogers was an indefatigable researcher on an intercontinental scale is attested to by his wide-ranging, World\'s Great Men of Color.1 Operating from the premise that ""the story of contacts of whites and blacks is usually told from the white angle,""', 'BLACK HISTORY UNBOUND 167 Rogers designed his capsule biographies as a source of inspiration to the young, particularly to those who were black. But in his desire to project a heroic black im age, he was sometimes carried away and his sketches of historical figures are shot through with hyperbole and panegyric. Another group who view the past from a special angle are the revolutionary black nationalists. They do not feel that history should be hero worship. ""Black history does not seek to highlight the outstanding contributions of special black people to the life and times of America,"" writes Vincent Harding, the eloquent Director of the Institute of the Black World in Atlanta. ""Rather our emphasis is on exposure, disclosure, or reinterpretation of the entire American past. We want to know America at its depths, now that invitations to its life are besieging us."" The revolutionary black nationalists are exponents of functional research, issue laden and action oriented. Not addressing themselves to pure, theoretical, knowledge-for its-own-sake investigation, they do not propose to scale the mountain simply because it is there. They hold that black studies, including history, should be a catalyst for the new day a-coming. To Nathan Hare, editor of The Black Scholar, ""a black studies program which is not revolutionary and nationalist is, accordingly, quite profoundly irrelevant."" Scorning objectivity as a species of ivory-towerism, the revolutionary nationalists hold that ideology and intellectualism are not incom patible, and that a person who has leaned too long in one direction may, for a time, have to lean in the other if he is to achieve balance. Essentially these nationalist intellectuals share many of the beliefs of the sociologist-psychiatrist, Frantz Fanon of Martinique, who held that ""African Negro"" culture would develop not around songs, poems, and folklore, but around the struggles of the people. ""White America,"" he said, was ""an organized im perialist force holding black people in colonial bondage."" The black revolutionaries address themselves to the task of decolonizing America, including her history. Fanon also held that for ""the wretched of the earth"" the way out was physical con frontation. He thus gave to violence an aura of romance, suggesting that it had a cleansing, releasing effect. Thus disdaining the doctrine of reconciliation and deter mined not to forget white America\'s massive assault upon the humanity of blacks, the revolutionary nationalists consciously choose to imprison themselves in the cas tle of color. The construct of the White Man dominates their thinking, much as the Devil was once the central figure in some Christian theologies. Nevertheless, we dismiss the black revolutionary nationalists at our intellectual and social peril. Even though we might not share their fondness for rhetorical flourishes and threatening hyperbole, their demand for heretical history must be carefully weighed, especially as they bring to their reflections a tunnel vision so often characteristic of the powerless people whose cause they proclaim. "" Let us not decide to imitate Europe,"" urged Fanon. ""Let us try to create the whole man, whom Europe has been incapable of bringing to triumphant birth."" The revolutionary black nationalist interpretation of the black experience is somewhat new in American thought, although the nationalist point of view is not.8 The Problem of Materials An old and recurring phenomenon in black history writing is the paucity of sources, the lack of hard data. Many questions must remain unanswered because', '168 BENJAMIN QUARLES there are no sources from which to formulate a trustworthy response. Negro sources are not easy to come by; documents, more often than not, are not readily accessi ble. The formal record is often thin, for most blacks were not articulate in a literary sense. John Chavis, Director of Behavioral Science Research at Tuskegee Institute\'s Carver Research Foundation, has posed the problem of the investigator: ""Where are the diaries, the family Bibles, the correspondence in fancy script tied in bundles? These are not, in most instances, part of the Negro past. Where are the silver services, the porringers, the samplers, the furniture dark and glossy, the oil portraits of awesome ancestors?"" Even when Negro memorabilia do exist, they are often hidden away in a basement or an attic, prey to fire or other loss. Such privately held material is invariably unprocessed. All too often even in major research libraries, particularly those of state and local historical societies, Negro related holdings have never been catalogued. Fortunately, the available sources are now being more widely publicized than ever before, and depositories are calling attention to their black-oriented materials, including early black newspapers and magazines on microfilm. The Quarterly Jour nal of the Library of Congress, for example, has devoted a special issue to its African materials.9 In the extent of its black documents, the Library of Congress is rivaled by a sister federal agency, the National Archives. In June, 1973, more than 150 scholars and interested parties attended a two-day ""National Archives Conference on Federal Archives as Sources for Research on Afro-Americans,"" a meeting which addressed itself to the agency\'s Negro-related materials (a number of them audiovisuals), including the originals of the well-known Emancipation Proclamation and the Civil War amendments.10 Historical societies have also begun to furnish guides to their Negro-related holdings.11 This itself is a hopeful sign in asmuch as research libraries, like museums and art galleries, are selective in their acquisitions; they do not buy or accept and certainly do not publicize anything they feel will have too low a yield in public or professional interest and prestige. During the past decade black source materials have profited from an infusion of oral history, created by interviewing selected persons of note and tape-recording and transcribing their remarks. What is, in essence, a memory bank of formal oral history was inaugurated a quarter of a century ago at Columbia University by Allan Nevins. In the first two decades of Columbia\'s Oral History Collection, of 200 in terviewees only three were black?W. E. B. DuBois, journalist George S. Schuyler, and Roy Wilkins. In orders received for micro-published copies of the memoirs, however, the top best seller as of April 1973 was that of W. E. B. DuBois, and the third-ranking best seller was that of Roy Wilkins. In recent years other oral history collections have sought Negro-related materials.12 The largest collection which concentrates on blacks is the Civil Rights Documentation Project at Howard University, dealing with black protest expres sion since 1954.18 Currently it includes 703 tape-recorded interviews, 60 conference tapes and 800 transcripts. In Alabama, seven predominantly black colleges have launched a Statewide Oral History Project ""to document the personal experiences of black Alabamians in their attempts to cope with racial prejudice and in their struggle to achieve racial equality.""14 The mounting jiumber of black research materials has led black librarians to seek ways to work cooperatively in providing reliable information on Afro', 'BLACK HISTORY UNBOUND 169 American bibliography. With an initial grant in June, 1971, from the U.S. Office of Education, the North Carolina Central University School of Library Science began a project to identify and coordinate all African-American materials in six southeastern states. A year earlier, a group of librarians and scholars, meeting in Philadelphia, formed the Association of African-American Bibliography, one of whose announced aims was the establishment of ""a Black Union Catalog on a regional and national basis."" By far the most urgent need in black history (and in black studies in general) is for just such a massive, comprehensive bibliography of black source materials, modeled along the lines of the National Union Catalog, compiled by the Library of Congress. Such a compilation might take a dual form, providing a catalogue of printed works and another of manuscripts. It would serve many interests. Although scholars would be the immediate beneficiaries, the academic community in general would profit. People in public life and in the media would benefit from the availability of a trustworthy guide to materials on black citizens and black-white relationships. Such a tool would also lead reformist groups to the data they need. Although publicizing the existing data would be a major step forward in black historiography, it should be accompanied by a re-examination of what is considered historical evidence, and an inclination to ask new questions of the data. In fields other than the natural sciences, basic theoretical frameworks have not been staked out, and in an evolving field like black history the play of flexibility and innovation has a special place. With no vested interest in one type of documentation, the researcher in black history can be eclectic in his selection of ways and means. In order to ferret out the true dimensions of the black past he may have to run some methodological risks. Certainly, this is not the place for watertight compartmen talization. Those who work in black studies must be prepared to ""stay loose,"" opening their minds to new approaches while subjecting the familiar ones to cons tant scrutiny. Traditional source materials on blacks are in particularly short supply for the periods preceding the Civil War. The African background of the New World blacks is, for example, very difficult to document, and illustrates the need for less traditional methodological approaches. The belief that black Africa had no history has a two-fold origin. With the coming of the European powers, Africa passed into a stage of colonialism. African history was not taught; indeed, the rulers assumed that no such history existed, it being one of their cardinal premises that the history of their subjects dated from their own arrival. Once determined to exploit Africa\'s human resources, Europeans, as men of conscience and religion, had to convince themselves of the innate inferiority of the natives. Furthermore, written records about West Africa prior to the coming of the Europeans are limited, and thus historical reconstruction is difficult and requires a number of technical skills. Hence, even a historian like Arnold Toynbee was led to believe that the black race was the only one that had made no creative contribution to any of the world\'s civilizations. Toynbee was careful to disavow the factor of race and color in accoun ting for the existence of advanced civilizations, but he did tend to make the error common to historians?that of overvaluing peoples for whom written records are abundant and underrating those for whom written records are relatively scarce. In contrast, however, L. S. B. Leakey has pointed out that ""men of science today are,', '170 BENJAMIN QUARLES with few exceptions, satisfied that Africa was the birthplace of man himself, and that for many hundreds of centuries thereafter Africa was in the forefront of all world progress.""16 As could be expected, the late Dr. Leakey was a social anthropologist. ""The most spectacular feature of the new post-war boom in African history,"" writes Philip D. Curtin, ""has been the development of new techniques for in vestigation, and the application of older techniques to the African past."" In a perceptive booklet,18 Curtin describes some of the fields which are throwing light on early Africa, including archeology, botanical evidence, linguistic studies, and the oral tradition. The oral tradition is particularly important because most precolonial African civilizations were ""oral civilizations"" documentable in no other way.17 Although the main emphasis in American history writing has traditionally been political and intellectual,\' areas in which the disadvantaged and anonymous masses did not have much direct impact, other facets of history, whose influence is now growing, take much greater notice of minorities. Social history, for example, views society as a whole, taking into account ordinary people and their patterns of living, and giving attention also to the phenomena of social protest.18 The urbanization of black Americans in the twentieth century has had a profound effect not only on blacks themselves but also on America\'s cities and on the country more generally. A number of excellent books have been written on the daily experiences of ordinary people in American cities.19 David M. Katzman has il lustrated the use of the concept of caste in black urban history.20 The National Ur ban League, an agency that has been on the cutting edge of the unprecedented cityward migration in the twentieth century, has been described and assessed by Guichard Parris and Lester Brooks21 in a book which deals with other major black institutions as well, including the church and the press. Black businesses, small and short-lived as a rule, have not attracted many researchers, but the distinct possibilities in black entrepreneurial history become clearly evident in a meticulous and interpretive study of the North Carolina Mutual Life by Walter Weare.22 Urban-based reform movements likewise constitute a fruitful line of investigation. August Meier and Elliott Rudwick, one trained in history and the other in sociology, have written a model study of core which suggests the desirability of collaborative efforts in black history.28 The broadening of the kinds of evidence now considered historical is also indicated by new quarterlies like Ethnohistory, with its emphasis on general culture, and the Journal of Interdisciplinary History, whose avowed purpose, as set forth in its first issue in the autumn of 1970, is to ""stimulate historians to examine their own subjects in a new light, whether they be derived from psychology, physics, or paleontology."" Psychohistory, a field of particular importance for minorities, is attracting new attention. This relatively unknown field includes group psychopathology, which touches on the fantasy life and self-image of minorities and on the positive aspects of their differences. It encompasses the best-selling work, Black Rage, in which psy chiatrists Charles Grier and Price M. Cobbs describe the impact of prejudice on Negro personality patterns. The newest historical periodical is History of Childhood Quarterly: The Journal of Psychohistory, which first appeared in the summer of 1973. Earle E. Thorpe, himself black like Grier and Cobbs, holds that', 'BLACK HISTORY UNBOUND 171 ""black history always has been cut more from the psychohistory mold than has been the case with modern white Occidental history."" In two case studies of Southern life, he challenges the ""hate-and-conflict"" image of black-white relationships in the antebellum South, holding instead that interracial responses and attitudes were characterized in part by intimacy and affection.24 Slave-born John Roy Lynch, Congressman from Mississippi during Reconstruction, concurred in this viewpoint, taking note of ""the bond of sympathy between the masses of the two races in the South."" Thorpe\'s viewpoints and procedures are stimulating and suggestive. Nevertheless, it is historical revisionism of no mean proportions to view racial relationships below the Potomac as a web of mutuality. In the less traditional branches of history, particularly those concerned with social behavior and action, investigators of the black experience are turning for in formation to lesser-mined ores, including church and police records, census publications, city directories, housing and unemployment files, local tax lists, pop ular culture materials (such as black discography), and legal documents. Court records form the base of historian Letitia Woods Brown\'s study, Free Negroes in the District of Columbia, 1790-1846.25 Black history stands to gain as more scholars receive training in demographic and family history and in the use of quantitative techniques, including computerized data processing. New Emphases in Black History The increasing receptivity to new types of source material for black history has brought about new analyses of familiar topics, such as slavery, and the concept of black uniformity. If, as Staughton Lynd asserts, slavery is ""a key to the meaning of our national experience,"" then we should have as balanced a portrayal of it as possible. Until recently, however, the standard view of slavery tended to reflect the attitudes of the master class. As Henry Steele Commager has pointed out: ""The slave-owner was literate and articulate, the Negro slave was illiterate and inar ticulate; it was, until recently, the slave-owner\'s version of slavery which came down to us and which was widely accepted as history."" The portrait of slavery that came down from the past was fashioned in the big house and not in slave row. Thus a historian like U. B. Phillips, using sources that represented the views of the masters, tended to depict the slave as contented and his surroundings as pleasant. According to Phillips, plantation life was punctuated by such congenial pastimes as ""the dance in the sugarhouse, the bonfire in the quarters with contests in clog dances and cakewalks, the baptizing in the creek with demonstrations from the sisters as they came dripping out, the rabbit hunt, the log-rolling, the house raising, the husking bee, the quilting party, and the crap game.""28 Today scholars interested in slavery give more prominence to the slave himself and take little stock in the theory of his total powerlessness. ""Any history of slavery must be written in large part from the standpoint of the slave,"" wrote Richard Hofstadter in 1944. Hitherto consigned to a position as a pawn, the slave is now regarded as a role player, and we are having second thoughts about the allegation that his nature and mentality were servile. We now realize that everybody on the plantation made history, the slave as well as the master. Something of the slave\'s experiential world and internal life may be gathered', '172 BENJAMIN QUARLES from an examination of his literature?his songs and narratives about bondage and freedom, written or oral. Mark Miles Fisher has opened our eyes to the subtle ""this-worldly"" character of the ostensibly ""other-worldly"" religious songs heard along slave row.27 Sterling Stuckey uses folk songs and folk tales to document his assertion that slaves were able to fashion a life style and set of values of their own.28 In efforts to reconstruct the slave\'s world, contemporary slave literature was, of course, a valuable historical source.29 In addition, the early decades of the twen tieth century witnessed a number of efforts to interview ex-slaves and record their impressions. The most comprehensive was conducted by the Federal Writers\' Pro ject of the Works Project Administration during the years 1936 to 1938, and resulted in 2,300 recorded interviews, over two-thirds with people over eighty years old.80 Used with proper professional safeguards, such nontraditional sources, helped by a fresh glance at the more conventional sources, tell us that slaves found many outlets for their creative energies and social instincts, outlets often hidden from, or un-noted by, their masters. We are now finding that a slave often took as his models of behavior and authority not his master alone, as Stanley Elkins has suggested, but blacks like himself?the sage, the preacher, the bold and defiant, the trickster slave so beloved in black folklore who was adept at ""puttin\' on ole massa,"" and even the driver who enforced the dictates of the white overseer. The range of options open to slaves was wider than we had believed, and we are now learning of the myriad ways in which they maintained considerable group solidarity despite the formidable odds against it. A second example of the many changes in black history is the increased emphasis on the concept that the black is not monolithic, a concept amply il lustrated in the rich field of biography and autobiography. In the eyes of others, black Americans often take on a massively uniform quality; if they are not viewed as looking alike, they are thought of as at least thinking and acting alike. This mis leading impression stems in part from a tendency to lump all blacks together?to typecast them?and in part from their understandably united and standard response to color discrimination. Blacks, for example, often vote as a bloc against a prejudiced or racially obtuse politician. Aside from their common cause against an adversary and a shared sense of hav ing been wronged, however, American blacks have been marked historically by diversity. Within themselves, they fall into a congeries of groups reflective of a typically American individualism. They have always had their own class lines. In ante-bellum America, the free black thought of himself as inhabiting a niche con siderably above that of the slave. And within the free black group there were further distinctions, including those based on skin color, occupation, schooling, and free ancestry. Slave society also had gradations. House servants had the most prestige; below them came the skilled laborers; and bringing up the rear were the field hands. In the quarter century following the Civil War, skin color (light or dark) loomed even larger as a status determinant; since 1900, however, in line with the national pattern, money has been the most important determinant of rank in the black American\'s unofficial who\'s who. With regard to religious affiliations and political party ties, as in other areas, blacks have had varied preferences. Since they have had no universally held', ""BLACK HISTORY UNBOUND 173 dogmas, they have never had an official spokesman; even Booker T. Washington, although he exercised great influence among prominent whites, could never speak for more than a fraction of his fellow blacks. The Communists made a strong bid for colored membership in the thirties, but found that they could make little headway against the black American's dislike for regimentation and for thinking in lockstep. Indeed, even in fighting discrimination, blacks have never agreed upon one approach or strategy, but have made proposals ranging from going back to Africa to setting aside a portion of the United States for black occupation. Blacks are persons as well as types. There is no such thing as a universally held black ideology or point of view. In America, land of individualism, there is no end to the number of ways of being black. The field of life-writing bears this out, revealing a multiplicity of disparate per sonalities. Slave narratives aside, black biography received its first great thrust with the publication, in 1887, of Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising, by William J. Simmons. A former slave who had become a clergyman and educator, Simmons consistently sounded an inspirational, eulogistic note in the 178 sketches he assembled.81 Simmons included no women in the hope, which proved vain, that he would be able to publish a companion volume devoted to them. From 1912 to 1952, sketches of black notables Were carried in the Negro Yearbook and Annual Encyclopedia of the Negro.32 In more recent years a number of professionally trained historians have published black collective biographies.88 There are also a number of black biography series in the field, most notably those of the University of Chicago84 and the Oxford University Press.85 In addition three of the most prominent of all American blacks, Frederick Douglass, W. E. B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington, are now coming under fuller study and investigation as efforts proceed to publish their papers.86 The Periodical Literature Afro-American History: A Bibliography, edited by Dwight L. Smith,87 is a com pendium of 2,900 abstracts on the black experience, compiled by combing the periodical literature from 1954 to 1971, a period in which awareness of the presence of blacks reached new heights, spurring a vast outpouring of articles. Better than any other single work, Afro-American History helps illuminate the new kinds of concerns that have become paramount; it tells much about the kinds of materials that are being used, the questions that are being raised, and the inter pretations that are becoming common. The focus of the bibliography is the United States, but other countries are not ignored and many of the articles come from foreign language periodicals. One abstract gives a sketch of American blacks in Czarist Russia, including the famed Shakespearean actor, Ira Aldridge; another suggests that in Italy the stage version of Uncle Toms Cabin has always been a great favorite, particularly in times of political crisis. Many of the abstracts carry a concluding sentence on the source materials used; one has only to take a random sample of these to sense their richness. Even when conventional sources, such as diaries and letters, are used, it is edifying to learn, for example, that George A. Matson, who operated as a barber, schoolmaster and"", '174 BENJAMIN QUARLES clergyman in Lincoln, Nebraska, kept a diary from 1901 to 1903; or that the former slave, Taylor Thistle, while studying theology in Nashville, sent seven letters to his benefactors. Photographs, electoral maps, church and regimental records?conven tional though they be?have importance, particularly when they shed light on Negro experience. The family Bible, with its record of births, marriages, and deaths, has its uses, particularly where, as in the case of blacks, other records of vital statistics are in short supply. Nonliterary sources appear infrequently, although some of the authors urge others to make use of them. Certain of the ar ticles are highly personal, essentially exercises in self-disco very. As David B. Davis makes clear elsewhere in this issue, slavery remains a prime subject of study, and recent literature suggests that the Reconstruction period also retains its fascination. If, on the one hand, we are reminded anew that there was no such thing as black rule and that many carpetbaggers were men of probity, we are also reminded increasingly of the political mind of the Negro, and of men like Richard Allen and Matt Gaines in the Texas legislature, who promoted state and regional measures beneficial to all. We learn of black-on-black political intimida tion, with black Republicans using strong-arm tactics on black Democrats. The historiography of the period is still the ""dark and bloody ground"" that Bernard Weisberger found it fifteen years ago. Afro-American History includes a number of articles on the age-old question as to whether the mean differences in intelligence scores between white and black children stem from environmental or genetic factors, and, although proponents of the latter have grown more defensive in recent years, they have not left the field. Contemporary periodical literature indicates an increase in studies comparing blacks with other groups. One author, comparing the Negro with the immigrant, concludes that the factor of race was crucial; the immigrant faced the problem of assimilation, to be sure, but he did not face the insurmountable wall of caste. Tackling the question of why Japanese-Americans have fared better than black Americans, one observer points to the former\'s smaller numbers and higher educational level. Another writer sees parallels in the relationships between Jews and peasants in prewar Eastern Europe and between Jews and Negroes in modern America; in each instance, he points out, the Jews regarded the other group as violence prone and lacking in culture. White-black violence is the topic of a great number of articles. Urban racial un rest, including its pr?cipitants and underlying causes, receives its full share of attention. Blacks viewed these disturbances as protests against racial discrimina tion, whereas whites saw them as conspiracies master-minded by Communists and outside Negroes. A race riot, even when viewed in retrospect, is a sobering ex perience. Yet, seen in a broader context, it is consistent not only with the nation\'s history in race relations but with the fact that Americans are a violence-prone peo ple even where the factor of race is not present.88 Among the topics which received little scholarly attention is the role of black women. Historically, women were hardly in the public eye; an article on the early history of Negro women in journalism, for example, yielded few names until the appearance of the militant Ida Wells Barnett of Memphis and Chicago at the turn of the twentieth century. As for the women\'s liberation movement of our own day, this is hardly a matter that attracts blacks or their chroniclers. To black men and', 'BLACK HISTORY UNBOUND 175 women, the battle of the sexes seems almost a diversion in light of the whole range of problems they have in common because of their color. On the other hand, recent black-oriented periodical literature has devoted con siderable attention to the discipline of black studies, a constellation of fields in college curriculum offerings in which history is the largest single component. Supplementing his use of this voluminous literature with visits to more than a hun dred colleges, Nick Aaron Ford published Black Studies: Threat or Challenge, in 1973.89 Professor Ford holds that while badly conceived black studies programs pose a threat to effective education, well-conceived programs ""are a threat to false and distorted scholarship."" Black studies generally are a challenge, calling upon ""the national educational establishment"" to re-examine ""moribund concepts and outmoded methods."" Mirroring the new awareness of Negro history, the literature has put historians themselves under scrutiny, noting their changing images of blacks. There are scores of articles on the treatment of blacks by historians. Some are broadly based; others deal with a particular historian, period, or event. Some indicate topics and themes that are deserving of further research. In American historiography blacks have sometimes been victimized more by be ing ignored than by overt prejudice; omission can of course be construed as a form of prejudice. This, however, is no longer a major problem. Although it may be premature to proclaim the full arrival of blacks in American history, they are at least now listed in the cast of characters; if their roles are still too often indeter minate, at least their names are now likely to be spelled correctly. In fine, this is a day of unusual ferment in black history?in its substantative outreach and in its documentation. In their quest for a usable past, blacks have done two things. They have helped reshape our assessment of ""what has actually happened,"" spurring the use of long-muted evidence. And they have helped alert us to the possibilities of alternate methodologies within the discipline itself. The concept of history ""from the bottom up,"" now so prevalent, is certainly not new, but a good portion of its present sweep and momentum unquestionably stems from the marked upturn of interest by scholars and laymen in the historic role played by Americans from Africa. In his thoughtful and imaginative book, The Future as History, Robert L. Heilbroner bids us not despair as we face the years that seem to loom so ominously before us, but instead to take heart, drawing upon a sense of historical identity and awareness. History does indeed remain the great synthesizing discipline, and Heilbroner is most persuasive in elucidating the grand dynamic of its forces. We must, however, proceed with due caution. A valid projection of the future as history, for all its importance, requires a fresh look at the past as history. ""No fact has ever been wholly ascertained, but a fact may be progressively ascertained,"" observes R. G. Collingwood; ""as the labour of historians goes forward, they come to more and more facts, and to reject with greater and greater confidence a number of mistaken accounts of them.""40 References 1.

http://www.jstor.org/stable/43390707,Fragments of Bone: Neo-African Religions in a New World,"['Dianne M. Stewart', 'Patrick Bellegarde-Smith']","['Fragments of Bone: Neo-African Religions in a New World. PATRICK BELLEGARDE-SMITH (ed.). Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2005. 262 pp. (Paper US$ 20.00) Dianne m. Stewart Department of Religion and African American Studies Emory University Atlanta GA 30322, U.SA. <dstewa4@emory.edu> Fragments of Bone is a timely anthology treating the legacies of African- derived, or as aptly noted in the subtitle ""Neo-African,"" religions in the Americas and the Caribbean. The scope of this collection is broad enough', 'Book Reviews 119 to cover more noted traditions such as Brazilian Candomblé, Haitian Vodou, and Cuban Santería. It also examines lesser-known conventions and cultural threads that bind Africa and its diasporas as well as Africans across the diaspora. These include a variety of themes and subjects: Central African martial arts as a rudimentary discipline expressed in African American ring shout innovations; the pivotal institutional role of women in a robust New Orleans Voodoo heritage; the Comfa religion as a site of Guyanese national identity; flexible and diverse conceptions of gender and sexuality in neo- African religious traditions; tapping the ""metalanguage"" (p. 65) of Vodou as a foundation for restructuring contemporary Haitian civic and public life; the phenomenon of twins in neo-African religions; critical engagements of African religious motifs in Brazilian and Cuban literatures; complementary religious practices among Akan communities in Jamaica and Africa; the life and work of a Cuban Espiritista; and ritual process in Lucumi Orisha tradi- tions. Twelve essays explore neo-African religions from sundry diasporic loca- tions with attention to the philosophical, theological, political, and aesthetic orientations they encode. ""Fragments of bone"" is a compelling image for theorizing African religions in the New World. While bones offer evidence that some life form has perished, they are also organic substances that live on, retaining energies and memories. Perhaps Patrick Bellegarde-Smith had Jahn\'s Muntu (1958) in mind by insisting that African religions are both old and new and that their novelty has more to do with the internal dynamism intrinsic to the generative ethos of all living things and the cultures/environ- ments living things produce than to any assumed ""syncretic"" essence. His point is that neo-African religions are no more or less syncretic than Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, a point sorely missed in scores of treatments of these misnomered traditions precisely because history has been constructed and told from the vantage point of the conquerors. Underscoring an important shift in studies of African diaspora religions, Bellegarde-Smith frames this volume with an introductory essay and query- ing title: ""What If History Were Written by the Vanquished?"" His insider- outsider position as houngan and scholar lends credibility to an integrative and collaborative approach to knowledge production, one that benefits not only from transdisciplinarity but also from translocation, something rarely encountered in the scholarship on African and African-derived religions. In penetrating the boundaries between theology and religion, technology and spirituality, politics and aesthetics, and time and space, the essays offer responses to Bellegarde-Smith\'s question. To take one example, time and space converge for Niyi Afolabi, who considers Brazil and Africa ""Siamese cultural spaces"" and Bahia ""a diaspora in reverse"" (p. 121). This insight res- onates with the connections Nancy Mikelson suggests between two women of African descent across time and space. For Mikelson, Eva Fernandez', '120 New West Indian Guide / Nieuwe West-Indische Gids vol. 82 no. 1 & 2 (2008) Bravo \'s transplantation of African-Cuban herbs to a community garden in the Frederick Douglass housing project in Upper West Side, Manhattan ""had a marvelous irony"" because ""Frederick Douglass\'s mother would have rec- ognized many of the \'simples\' in Maria\'s garden"" (p. 239). Here Mikelson returns to the maternal heritage of a man audiences are prone to associate with the cultural conventions of Western Christianity but who confesses he experienced authentic freedom from the whip and shackles of slavery after accepting the nkisi of an African root doctor named Sandy Jenkins (Douglass et al. 2001). Coupled with Ina Fandrich\'s pioneering research on Voudou sisterhoods in New Orleans, readers are invited to engage in more precise local and comparative studies of African American/Caribbean women\'s religious experiences - to examine history from the standpoint of the vanquished. Gender analysis is just one place to begin among the vanquished. Perhaps another location would be formulating a credible scholarly response to Congophobic discourse (demonization of Congo/Central African traditions) in the African diasporic record. Maureen Warner Lewis (1991) and Monica Schüler (1980), among others, have noted such patterns in their studies of African slave societies and diasporic religions. Rafael Ocasio also presents corroborating data in his essay on Cuban Santería without remark (p. 104). Several contributors to this volume critically engage the wider Afrophobic cultural milieu condemning African traditions as a whole and the nation state\'s appropriation of neo- African religions to quell Black consciousness, social resistance, and political dissent. This type of analysis must also extend to the Congophobic narrative that was generated within African diasporic slave communities. Among many emergent themes in the volume is the comparative trans- atlantic study of ethnic African societies during the slave era. Osei-Mensah Aborampah\'s essay comparing Akan religious practices in Africa and the Jamaican diaspora complements the research of scholars such as Michael Gomez (1998), James Sweet (2003), and Linda Heywood (2002) who inter- rogate the interfacing of ethnic African, pan- African, and African American/ Caribbean communities in the formation of African diasporic identities over centuries of encounter. In considering a wealth of spiritual intelligence across the African dia- spora, Fragments of Bone introduces a conceptual framework for interpreting the legacies of African religious cultures in the Americas and the Caribbean as synthetic repertoires, offering readers a perspective on the extension of African civilization(s) to the New World. It shifts the scholarly lens away from dichotomous and static approaches to ""Africanisms"" and instead dem- onstrates how, as Niyi Afolabi writes, ""Africa remains not only a significant but a signifying intertext"" in the Americas and the Caribbean (p. 111). The task is no longer that of isolating African retentions; it is now to acknowledge', 'BOOK REVIEWS 121 that, as Bellegarde-Smith puts it, ""the use of the drum does not preclude playing the accordion or the violin"" (p. 65). Exploring religion as a site for sociopolitical enactments as well as varied cultural disciplines and technolo- gies, the contributors to this volume brilliantly demonstrate the global ambit of West and Central African civilizations and their transnational influence across Africa and the African diaspora.

http://www.jstor.org/stable/44208557,THE RESTORATION OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS IN THE UNITED STATES: 1806 to 1815,['Peter Guilday'],"['THE RESTORATION OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS IN THE UNITED STATES 1806 to 1815 From August 16, 1773, untü August 7, 1814, the Society of Jesus was outlawed by the Church of God. The execu- tion of the fatal order of Clement XIV was left to the in- dividual Bishops throughout the world. With the exception of Prussia and Russia, where the sovereigns refused to destroy the Society, confiscation and suppression were car- ried out to the letter. The English ex-Jesuits had obtained in 1778, papal sanction by the Brief Catholici Praesules for their Academy at Liège where they remained until 1794, when the masters and scholars migrated to Stonyhurst.1 The Liège School was the last oasis iti an educational désert created by Bourbon hatred and papal acquiescence. Itś continuance under ex-Jesuit control is one of the remark- able pages in Jesuit history. Most of the American clergy - all Jesuits in 1773 - had, like Bishop Carroll, passed through Liège to their ordination and final profession. The same enmity which left no stone unturned to suppress the remnant of the Society in White Russia, was in evidence asi the English Academy at Liège progressed. It is not difficult to surmise what would have been the ultimate condition of the Society today, had not the Suppression reacted upon the very courts that had so insolently demanded it from the Holy See. The Interim ( 1773-1814) is synchronous with the collapse of Bourbonism in Europe. Throughout the world, during 1iHughes, History of the Society of Jesus, etc., Documents , vol. i, part ii, p. 683, oote 33 .', '178 American Catholic Historical Society these forty years of Suppression, the members of the Society looked to the White Russian Province as a link with their great past, in case the future should warrant the restoration of the Society; and foremost among those of the Society who were determined to profit by every advant- age were the English ex-Jesuits. After their migration toi Stonyhurst, the Abbé de Broglie, representing the Pacca- narists, came to London, in 1797, for the purpose of urging the English ex- Jesuits to join the new union. Among those who became members of this group was Father Charles Forrester, who had been present at Carroll\'s con- secration.2 The movement met a strong opponent in Car- roll\'s life-long friend, Father Charles Plowden, who preached his consecration sermon. "" There was much to recommend a junction between the ex-Jesuits and the new society,"" writes Ward, ""their anomalous position would have come to an end, and they would have found themselves members of an Order of similar aims and rules resembling those to which they had been so long voluntarily adhering/\' 9 The English ex-Jesuits wisely refrained from taking part in Abbé de Broglie\'s project, for in 1801, Pius VII formally approved by the Brief Catholicae Fidei the existence of the Society of Jesus in Russia. On May 27, 1803, the English ex-Jesuits succeeded in obtaining oral permission from the same pontiff for the aggregation to the Russian Province.4 Father Gruber, the General, appointed Father Marmaduke Stone, then President of Stonyhurst College, Superior of the affiliated English Jesuits. All that was asked of the 2 Forrester to Carroll, Lulworth, May 6, 1803 ( Baltimore Cathedral Archives, Case 3-O8. ) 3 Ward, Eve of Catholic Emancipation, vol. i, pp. 208-209. London, 1911. 4 Plowden to Carroll, London, July 19, 1803. Such an application had been made and the English ex-Jesuits expected permission to proceed as they desired in the matter ( Baltimore Cathedral Archives, case 6-Q3).', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 179 former members of the Society was to perform a spiritual retreat and to renew their vows. Father Stone\'s authority was indeed based upon the celebrated vivae vocis or acutum, understood to have been granted by Pius VII to Father Gruber\' s agent in Rome, Father Angelioni. Bishop Milner tells us in a letter to Archbishop Troy (February 27, 1805) that "" my friend, Charles Plowden stood out for a time, saying that without a public instrument under the Pope\'s hand, it might be disavowed and overturned in a moment. At length, however, he complied and accordingly pronounced his vows on August 15, 1804."" 5 A regular novitiate was opened at Hodder, near Stonyhurst, in a house given to the Society by Mr. Weldon, and Father Charles Plowden be- came first Master of Novices. Henceforth they were able to live as Jesuits, although the permission granted by Pius VII was of a private nature and was to be kept secret. Even Cardinal Borgia, Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda, which was the administrative court for Eng- land and America, was not told of this partial restoration. It was impossible, however, to keep the matter a secret, and Cardinal Borgia wrote rather vehemently to Bishop Douglass, Vicar-Apostolic of the London District, on De- cember 3, 1803, protesting against any recognition of the Jesuits in England. He requested him to notify confiden- tially the other Vicars-Apostolic that the Society existed only within the confines of Russia, and then only because the Holy See was powerless before the Empress Catherine who protected the Jesuits. On March 17, 1804, the Cardinal Prefect wrote in the same vein to Bishop Milner. Cardinal Borgia acknowledged that he had become aware of the general opinion that Pius VII had restored the Society and that houses might be begun wherever a sufficient group of Jesuits might be gathered. He called Bishop Milner\' s at- 5 Cited by Ward, op. cit., vol. i, p. 210. (From the Archiépiscopal . Archives of Dublin.)', 'i8o American Catholic Historical Society tention to the fact that the permission granted by the Holy See on March 7, 1801, was "" intra Russiaci Imperii fines dumtaxat et non extra."" Wherefore, the General of the Society had no right to revive the Society outside the Rus- sian frontiers and likewise had no right to aggregate those living in other countries to the remnant existing in Russia. The Cardinal-Prefect then added in no unmistakable terms that the vivae vocis orctculum was false. Bishop Milner wasi warned not to allow the ex- Jesuits of England to affiliate themselves to Russia, but to consider them as secular dio- cesan priests.® Later in 1804, Bishop Gibson had written to Father Stone, giving him the message contained in Bor- gia\'s letter, but the English Provincial was too well ac- quainted with the actual position of the Society in the eyes of the Holy See to be misled by Borgia, who was an acknow- ledged opponent of the Society. Father Stone stood firmly upon the permission granted in the vivae voeis oraculúm, "" for he had received repeated assurances from the Father- General that the Holy Father had approved all that the English Jesuits had so far done, and he was aware that the Holy Father might have reasons for not communicating his will even to Propaganda."" 7 In spite, therefore, of Cardinal Borgia\'s hostility, the English Jesuits continued with their work at Stonyhurst and at Hodder. There were continual difficulties for the next twenty-five years, not the least of which was the fact that the presence of the Society of Jesus in England was made an obstacle to Catholic Emancipation by the anta- gonists of that measure. The English Jesuits did not receive the full benefit of the Bull of Restoration of 1814 until January 1, 1829, 6 From the Birmingham Diocesan Archives. The original Latin letter will be found in Ward, op. cit., vol. iii, pp. 287-288. 7 Pollen, An Unobserved Centenary , in the Month , iMay, 1910, p. 361.', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 181 when Leo XII declared it to have force in England. The Catholic Emancipation Bill, which received the royal assent on April 13, 1829, contained a penal clause against the existence of the Jesuits in England, but it was never en- forced. ""The sons of the Society in England,"" writes Father Pollen, "" probably suffered less under the Suppres- sion than did the Jesuits of any other country in Europe. In England, the Society had always been remarkably popu- lar, and the proportion of the Jesuits in the total number of the clergy had always been unusually high."" 8 There were strong adhesive forces active among the Fathers in Eng- land as well as in the United States during the Interim, and the English Jesuits were the first, the American Jesuits the second, to request aggregation with Russia. Both branches of the Society were to be allowed to reorganize on the old lines. The history of the English Jesuits during this period (1773-1814) is an important background for the study of the Restoration of the Society in the United States. Every aspect of the Interim in England had i tá direct reaction upon the ex-Jesuits in America. Father John Carroll was one of .the very few English-speaking Jesuits who were at Rome during the period immediately preceding the Suppres- sion. When, on January 23, 1772, he wrote from Rome to Father Ellerker, S. J., one of the English professors at Liège, that "" our catastrophe is near at hand, if we must trust to present appearances and the talk of Rome"", he knew that the Society was doomed; and his letters of this period show how poignant was his grief at being obliged to hide his identity in Rome, even when traveling with so prominent a person as Lord Stourton\'s son. John Carroll never forgot those days of anguish at the centre of Christ- endom, and that fact must be remembered when in later 8 Pollen, I. c., p. 362.', '1 82 American Catholic Historical Society years, as Bishop of Baltimore, he apparently showed reluc- tance at the prospect of restoring the Society. When Bishop Challoner (October 6, 1773) forwarded to America the Brief of Suppression, the Jesuits here submis- sively signed and returned the document which destroyed not only their solidarity but also placed the ban of the Church upon that sublime religious ideal for which they had sacrificed their home ties and their fortunes and by which they had regulated their lives from youth to manhood and, in most cases, to old age. There was no Vicar- Apostolic around whom they could rally for safety, as their brethren in England were able to do; and only upon the uncertain authority which remained to their veteran leader, John Lewis, could they base their future activities; but the thought and the spirit which dominated these men, from 1773 onwards, was the restoration of the Society, at least in their own land of America. In spite of the Revolution- ary War (1775-1783), they managed to keep in touch with the former English Jesuits, and every step made towards the reorganization of the Society in England had its cor- responding effect upon the hopes of the Americans. The decree of Suppression allowed the ex-Jesuits who submitted, the privilege of remaining in the parishes where they were, but under the jurisdiction of the local bishops. This no doubt amused the despoiled Americans, for there were no resident priests in the country, except ex- Jesuits, and no bishops nearer than London, Quebec, or Santiago de Cuba.® That they felt the injustice of the "" Ganganelli Brief "" keenly is only too patent to him who reads the cor- respondence of the years 1773-1806. The disturbed coti- 9 "" Ma che cosa si farà con quelli . che vivono meli\' America, per così dire, in un altro mondo senza aver tra loro niè Vescovo, nemeno un Prete, che sia di un ordine diverso del loro/ "" - \'Challoner to Stonor, London, September 14, 1773, quoted by Hughes, op. cit., Documents , vol. i, part ii, p. 604.', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 183 dition of the American colonies during the War for American Independence afforded little chance for meetings of any sort, and the main endeavor of the American ex- Jesuits was to establish regulations for the perpetua- tion of the laborers in the vineyard here. Occasionally rumors reached them from England that Propaganda was! busy planning the confiscation of all the old Jesuit estates, and Carroll\'s attitude to which reference has already been made, must have put spirit into his English brethren when his letter of September 26, 1783, was read by Plowden to the members of the Society in England. Carroll\'s utterance on this occasion is the keynote to his whole life as priest, Prefect-Apostolic, Bishop and Archbishop, for he formally declared that "" foreign temporal jurisdiction will never be tolerated here "" in America. The earliest voiced declaration that the American Fathers wanted the Society restored in the United States is to be found in the resolution of the First General Chapter of the Clergy at White Marsh, under date of November 6, 1783 : The Chapter declare for themselves, and as far as they can for their constituents, that they will to the best of their power promote and effect an absolute and entire restoration to the Society of Jesus, if it should please Almighty God to re-establish it in this country, of all property belonging to it ; and, if any person, who has done good and faithful service to religion in this country, should not re-enter the Society so re-established, he is nevertheless to receive a comfortable maintenance whilst he continues to render the same services, and to be provided for as others in old age or infirmity.10 This resolution embodies the spirit which ruled the ex- Jesuits here until the American restoration came in 1806. And so thoroughly did they believe in the nearness of such an event that they began organizing at once into a Clergy 10 Hughes, op. cit., Documents , vol. i, part ii, p. 628.', '184 American Catholic Historical Society Corporation for the purpose of preserving the property of the Society intact for that magna dies when they would meet again under the standard of Ignatius Loyola. They fore- saw that encroachment on these property rights might arise from two sources : first, from the clerical "" newcomers "" into the country; and secondly from the person invested with spiritual jurisdiction in this country. Without a novi- tiate - and one was impossible to a non-existent religious Order - their own membership was doomed to constant losses by death; priests from foreign lands would un- doubtedly come with their flocks to this country and soon these "" newcomers "" would outnumber the older men. The properties, while not important in size or in value, were not considered by the ex- Jesuits as belonging to themselves per- sonally or collectively: they were pious funds and pious donations of lands and of houses for the support of religion in the American Missions, and as such the rigorous tenetsi of Canon Law governed their usage and their sale. In spite of all that has been written and published to the contrary, it is impossible to prove that the ex-Jesuits were ever recreant to this trust. Difficulties did arise, after Carroll and hisi successor Neale went to their graves, but through the whole controversy in Maréchal\' s day, the problem at issue was not objectively a personal one but one to be adjudged by can- onical procedure. They showed no hesitancy in accepting the "" newcomers,"" even though amongst them there were some to be found who shared the popular European satisfac- tion in the suppression of the Society. The Clergy Cor- poration was a protective association not for the ex-Jesuits, but for these estates which to them were sacred, in origin as well as in destination. Every newcomer accepted by| Carroll as Prefect-Apostolic was eligible for membership in the Corporation, providing he submitted to these wise and salutary regulations. As far as the second danger waá concerned, namely from the person who would be appointed', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 185 over the American Church, in whatever capacity, they saw no difficulty, if he was one of their own members; but as^ superior ( Prefect- Apostolic, Vicar- Apostolic, or Bishop) he was to have no power "" over or in the temporal property of the Clergy."" Carroll\'s appointment as Prefect- Apostolic was the beginning of a more compact ecclesiastical organiza- tion, but it is very clear from the proceedings of the other General Chapters that, until the American priests were» cer- tain of the extraordinary and unusual privilege of electing a bishop for the United States, a prelate with ordinary juris- diction was not welcome. When John Carroll was elected by them as their first Bishop, one of his earliest acts (May 26, 1790) was to sign a declaration to the effect that the See of Baltimore would have no rights accruing to it from the former Jesuit estates. Again must this firm stand be in- terpreted as a protective measure with the same end in view. Carroll\'s declaration is as follows : To prevent any disagreement or contention hereafter be- tween the Bishop of Baltimore and his Clergy, or any of them, in consequence of any words contained in his Holiness\'s brief for erecting the See of Baltimore &c. ; I hereby declare that I do not conceive myself entitled by the said brief to claim any right of interference in the management of those estates in Maryland and Pennsylvania, which were heretofore applied to the maintenance of the Jesuit missioners; and since their extinction, to the ex- Jesuits, and other Clergymen admitted to partake of their labor, in serving the Congregations, which were before served by the Jesuits.11 Under this private arrangement Bishop Carroll strove tö live until his death, in 1815. He received annually the sup- port voted in his favor at the General Chapter of 1789, and little difficulty arose on this score. Meanwhile, the reorganization of the Society of Jesus 11 Cited by Hughes1, /. c., p. 699.', '1 86 American Catholic Historical Society in the United States was not lost to sight. Father Carroll^ correspondence on the subject with the English ex- Jesuits grows in volume as the years pass. Evidently, in reply to one of his letters, Father Thomas Talbot, the Procurator of the dissolved English Province of the Society, wrote to Car- roll, from London, on September 21, 1784, stating that, liv- ing as thç Americans did, in "" a free State, independent of foreign potentates and cabals, where liberty of conscience is not controlled, where Catholicity was first planted by the Jesuits, has hitherto been nursed by the Jesuits and solely brought by them to the perfection it now enjoys,"" it should be an easy matter for the former members of the Society inj the United States to affiliate themselves with the Jesuit Province in White\' Russia, which was still unsuppressed, and over which Father Gruber, the Father-General presided. If this were done, and Father Talbot hopes there was none amongst the Americans "" who would not fly to his colours with eagerness,"" many European Jesuits, and especially those in England, "" would flock to you and would think themselves happy to end their career under the same banner they began it."" When the dissension arose at the Second General Chapter (1786) over the resolution to establish a school ""for the education of youth and the perpetuity of the body of clergy in this country,"" Father Carroll argued in reply that such a school would certainly become "" a nursery from whence postulants can alone be expected,"" and in the same document we find the following expression of sentiment regarding the Society of Jesus : We must bring to your minds that doleful era of the dis- solution of the Society of Jesus, when we were torn from our dear Mother, whom we saw sacrificed before our eyes to the designs permitted by Divine Providence. In consequence of this we were left without father, without mother, oppressed with grief, uncertain of our future destiny. In these melan-', ""Restoration of Jesuits in United States 187 choly circumstances, a formula of subscription to episcopal government was presented to us from our Ordinary, the Bishop of London, who was directed by the Holy See to doļ the same.12 That the former members of the Society in America were discussing the Russian affiliation proposals as early as Car- roll's appointment as Prefect- Apostolic is evident from a letter of Father Farmer to Carroll, dated Philadelphia, August 7, 1785 : What concerns our union with the Jesuits of Russia, tho' for my private satisfaction I wish it may be affected ; yet does it seem to me, that the body of our Clergy here in General would not reap benefit by the union. First it is not likely that we could draw thence any supplies. 2ndly it would not joyn or link us better together unless they were all satisfy d and had or reassumed the Spirit of the Society. 3rdly, as it seems, supplies must ex parte come from secular or other re- ligious clergy; our particular union would create a jealousy. For these reasons I keep in my particular desire of the Union ; tho' I am pretty confident that Providence had not brought about such a strange establishment, as is that of the Society in Russia, did it not mean to continue it.1® Confiscation of the ex- Jesuit estates was being mooted about that time by some of the Maryland politicians, as we learn in Carroll's letter to Antonelli, of March 13, 17865 and in order to avoid such an eventuality, the American 12 Ibid., p. 605. Carroll was long familar with the proposal to unite with the Russians. There is extant a letter to this effect from one of the Russian Jesuits to Carroll, dated October 14, 1783, in the Balti- more Cathedral Archives, Case 2-V8. That 'Carroll was fully aware of the English ex- Jesuit sentiment for the Russian affiliation is evident from Plowden's letters of March '29, and June 28, 1786, ini the Baltimore Cathedral Archives , Case 6-J10-11. 18 Baltimore Cathedral Archives , case 6-P11; printed in the Re- cords (American Catholic Historical 'Society), vol. xix, pp. 389-390."", 'i88 American Catholic Historical Society Clergy Corporation made every effort to secure a legal status before the State. Many objections were raised against granting the Corporation a Charter, but it finally passed the Assembly on December 23, 179 2. 14 An interesting incident occurred at this time. While Carroll was in Rome (1772-3), he made an unsuccessful attempt to meet Father John Thorpe, who became later his agent at Propaganda. Father Thorpe seems to have been one of the party of Jesuits who issued at the time of the election of Clement XIV a libellous attack on that Pope under the title De Simoniaca Electione. After the Suppres- sion, in a series of letters to Father Charles Plowden, Thorpe described the conditions of Rome, and he embodied some of the stories anent the Pope. In fine, the letters give a complete and intimate sketch of Ganganelli\'s life. These letters, it is generally believed, were indiscreetly published by Father Plowden as A Candid and Impartial Sketch of the Life and Government of Pope Clement XIV (London, 1785). The work was deemed so scandalous that it was suppressed, and Father Thorpe was put on parole not to leave Rome for three months. Bishop Milner, Mr. Weld, Lord Arundell, Rev. Thomas Bellamy, Father Charles Cor- dell and others wrote against the book. It is probable that the American Jesuits never saw the book, but there was another, written by Father Plowden, which had consider- able influence upon their plans for aggregating themselves toi Russia, This was the Mss. Account of the Preservation and Actual State of the Society of Jesus in the Russian Empire Dominion,1* to which Carroll refers in his letter of July ii, 1786: ""I found your two most acceptable fav- ours .... and at the same time your invaluable ms, ac- count of the remnant of the Society, miraculously preserved, 14 Hughes, I c pp. 635, 722. 15 Printed in Dolman\'s Magazine, vol. v (1846-1847); cf. Gillow, Biographical Dictionary of English Catholics , vol. v, p. 323-324.', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 189 as it seems, to be the seed of a future generation. I have read it with great eagerness and infinite pleasure. . . ."" 16 Again, on November 13, 1786, he speaks of Plowden\'s! "" most valuable Ms. which may be called the history of a providential deliverance of the Society from utter destruc- tion."" 17 The Ms. was passed from hand to hand among the American Fathers, and while it seems to have had no appreciable effect in stimulating their desire actually to join the Russian Province, it undoubtedly had an influence in their purpose to reestablish themselves as members of the suppressed Society. Two years later (April 25, 1788), thirteen of the Ameri- can ex-Jesuits issued a circular, probably the composition of Leonard Neale, calling upon all the "" Reverend Gentlemen formerly of the Society of Jesus in Maryland and Pennsyl- vania "" to attend a meeting at St. Thomas\' Manor, on the Monday following the third Sunday of July, when measures were to be adopted for the restoration of the Jesuits in America : Most Esteemed and Reverend Brethren , It is with the great distress of mind that we consider the various disturbances, which have agitated us in this part of the world, since the destruction of the Society of Jesus. Upon our exclusion from that happy government, we sincerely endeavoured to obviate every inconvenience by substituting another form of government, proportioned, as nearly as we could judge, to the circumstances in which we found our- selves. But it seems that this established form has not pro- duced that harmony and regularity, without which all is thrown into confusion, and we [are] compelled to surrender the idea of ever enjoying true comfort or happiness amidst the fatigues of our laborious Mission. This uncomfortable pro- spect naturally revives the memory of our former feelings 16 Hughes, I. c ., p. 683. 1 7 Ibid., p. 683.', ""i go American Catholic Historical Society and ideas. Our eager thoughts, by an uncontrollable biass, fix upon our dear and ancient Mother the Society, whilst, by a retrospective glance, we view the perfection of her unpar- alleled form of government, which ever preserved the most perfect union among her members, and, by her influencing energy filled all with a happiness that sweetened their labours, and afforded solid comfort in difficulties and distress. Yes, Revd. Gentlemen, we conceive this government of the Society to be the only one that can procure us the happiness our hearts are in search after. We have felt her controul, we have experienced her influence, which have stamped impres- sions on our souls not to be erazed. In pursuit of this our object, we will not, we cannot loose sight of a reunion with our darling Mother, till such time as Providence shall frustrate our active endeavours, and point out this impossibility. We have therefore come to a full determination of applying for this reunion, a determination not to be baffled by any attempts. We most sincerely wish for the unanimous concurrence of all our Brethren in this important affair. However, all being free, we reflect on none. We solicit none to subscribe to this determination, but such as are of the sentiments with our- selves.18 The names signed to this remarkable expression of belief in the future of the Society were: Walton, Matthews, Boar- man (John), Jenkins, Pile, Neale (Leonard,) Roels, Doyne, Boone, Boarman (Sylvester), Beeston, Graessl, and Moly- neux. John Carroll's name is not among these, and that apparently for two reasons. The first no doubt had to dò with his post as Prefect-Apostolic. As head of the Amer- ican Church, his immediate superior was the Cardinal-Pre- fect of the Congregation of Propaganda Fide. The Sacred Congregation was certainly then not in favor of the* restora- tion of the Jesuits. Even later, Pius VII, for example, did not announce to Propaganda the Restoration in 1814.19 18 Ibid., pp. 683-684. 19 Ward, Eve etc., vol. i, p. 2110; cf. 'Hughes, /. c., p. 817."", 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 191 The second reason is that Carroll had begun to waver in his belief that the Society in the United States was capable of restoration. About the time of the circular letter, he wrote to Father Beeston, one of its signers, at Philadelphia (March 22, 1788) : "" I considered farther that it is very uncertain how long the spirit of the Society will be kept alive, at least ini this country. I am afraid not much longer than they live who have been trained under its discipline."" 20 Perhaps, a third reason might be added : the attacks being made upon him by Fathers Poterie and Smyth in their publi- cations, in which they alleged that he showed favoritism to- wards the old members of the Society. In two letters tot Charles Plowden at this time, Carroll gives voice to his fear of being deluded in the restoration. On May 8, 1789, he says: "" O poor Jesuits! when shall we have you again? You communicated in your last some dubious information concerning them. I have been so often the dupe of my hopes, that I am becoming very incredulous to reports of any favourable turn in their affairs."" 21 Again, on July 12, 1789, he writes: "" It is singular enough, that some of our own friends are blaming me for being too irresolute or in- different, for not adopting their most intemperate councils with respect to restoring the Society; whilst, on the other hand, Smyth, the Abbé [ Poterie ] and others, are accusing me of sacrificing to this intention the good of religion.,, 22 W e do not know what the results of the July, 1 788, meet- ing were, but they could not have been very encouraging, for no mention of the restoration is made in the Proceedings of the Third General Chapter of the Clergy, held at White- 20 Hughes, /. c ., p. 616. tit is about this time that Carroll\'s corres- pondence with Father Strickland on the question of the aggregation to Russia begins.

The principal questions at issue in that meeting were the proposed bishopric for the United States and the incorporation of the ex- Jesuit estates. Car- roll himself was preoccupied with the thought of his election to the episcopate by his fellow priests, and also with the serious troubles some of the foreign priests in the country were causing. He gives us also a hint for the proper under- standing of his attitude on the question of restoring the Society in a letter to Plowden thanking him for congratula- tions on his election to the See of Baltimore: . . . Your condolence would have suited better the situation of my mind; every day furnishes me with new reflections, and almost every day produces new events, to alarm my con- science, and excite fresh solicitude at the prospect before me. You cannot conceive the trouble I suffer already, and still greater which I foresee, from the medley of clerical character coming fnom differetnit quarters and Various educations, and seeking employment here. I cannot avoid employing some of them, and they begin soon to create dis- turbance. As soon as this happens, they proceed to bring in Jesuitism, and to suggest that everything is calculated by* me for its restoration; and that I sacrifice the real interestsi of religion to the chimerical project of reviving it."" 23 Occasionally letters arrived from England asking for in- formation on the progress being made in the aggregation of the American ex- Jesuits to the Russian Province. The English members of the suppressed Society could not under- stand why the Americans were not more prompt, living in a land where there could be no opposition on the part of the government. Father Carroll was now Bishop-elect of the See of Balti- more, and therefore bound by even stronger ties to the) 23 Carroll to Plowden, Baltimore, October 23, 1789, printed in Hughes, /. c., p. 688.', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 193 Sacred Congregation. He foresaw that as chief shepherd he would foe forced sooner or later to take action on the re- storation being planned by his former brethren in the Society. His views on this delicate matter on the eve of his departure for London are in a letter, dated March 16, 1790 to Plowden: "" My Brethern here have been deluding themselves, for a long time, with ideas of a restoration, founded on what appeared to me very shallow support in- deed. But at present I cannot help thinking, that the late convulsions in Europe, when traced to their real sources, must discover to every thinking mind the necessity of a virtuous, education, and of encouraging men, capable of conducting the rising generation through all the degrees of moral, religious and literary improvement. Om whom then can the governing powers turn their eyes, but on those who are trained under the discipline of the Society? A few seminaries or universities may be indeed supplied with ex- cellent instructors without recurring to them. But numer- ous professors, sufficient to fill the chairs of every consider- able town, cannot be formed and held to their duty, except it be in a body, constituted as the Society. . . 24 During his stay in London, it was but logical that he would do his utmost to set aside the charge made by Smyth that he favored the ex- Jesuits in the selection for parishes. This charge was a threadbare one to the English Jesuits and it was difficult for Carroll to arouse their interest. Dr. Carroll reached London in stirring times. Bishop James Talbot, Vicar- Apostolic of the London Dictrict, died at Hammersmith, January 26, 1790, and London for the first time in a century was without a bishop. "" While Bishop Talbot lay dying. Catholic England was working itself up into a ferment over the question of the Oath, nor was even a temporary cessation deemed necessary out of respect for 24 Ibid., p. 682.', '194 American Catholic Historical Society his memory when he died."" 25 It was not until the week following Carroll\'s consecration that London received its Bishop in the person of the Rt. Rev. John Douglass. The Oath of Allegiance had been the cause of dissension, con- troversy, schism and martyrdom since the days of Elizabeth, and during the summer of 1790, a war of pamphlets about it was being carried on by the two factions among the Catholics. Carroll\'s friend, Charles Plowden, was in the thick of the fight, and it must have been a novel experience for America\'s first Bishop to follow the actions of the Cath- olic Committee in its determined stand against accepting Bishop-elect Douglass. The opposition lasted until the end of the year, but finally the new Bishop-elect won his way to the hearts of the gentlemen of the Committee, and on December 19, 1790, Bishop Douglass was consecrated at the chapel at Lulworth Castle, by Bishop Walmesley, the con- secrator of Bishop Carroll. Charles Plowden preached also at the consecration of Bishop Douglass, as he had done at Lulworth on August 15, when Dr. Carroll was consecrated. The summer of 1790 in London brought Dr. Carroll into personal touch with all the \'Catholic leaders, lay and cleric, of England, and as a consequence, his correspondence with Plowden down to 1815 contains many references to the Oath and the Catholic Relief Bill. On September 2, 1790, he wrote from "" King\'s Street, London,"" to Father Plowden as f ollows : My dear Sir Many thanks for yours of Aug. 31st., and for your sollici- tude that I should clear myself to Cardi.

Coghlan brought me today some of that vile Man's Performances; not against me: but some that he foolishly published concerning himself, on his first coming to Boston and a sort of pastoral instruction, which he had the temerity and folly to publish there before the Lent of 1788. I shall give 'Cardi. Antonelli very satisfactory reasons for coming to England. Neither the president of Doway, nor Mr. Wm. Meynell are yet come to town; nor even Mr. Thos. Meynell. There is great inconsistency in the objections, which some make, not to the truth of your doctrine respecting the Pope's Infallibility, but the policy of asserting it in print at this time. They say with Mr. Reeve, that the English generally under- stand, that by infallibility we mean to assert the Pope's infal- lible prerogative in all orders he issues, or facts which he as- serts. Now if this be true, where is the impolicy of your as- serting that the pope has no such infallibility; but only in doctrinal points. To obviate this observation, which I made yesterday to Mr. Chs. Butler, he said, contrary to your other opponents, that the English not only object to the pope's infal- libility in giving orders stating facts (an infallibility asserted by no one) but likewise consider his doctrinal infallibility as a pernicious tenet and dangerous to civil government. I have a letter from the Nuncio at Paris, and another from Monsg. Emery, Superior Geni, of the Seminary of St. Sulpice. They both sollicit my passage to Paris to confer with some gentle- men of the Seminary, who wish to employ in the rearing of young clergymen in America, that experience, which is made useless by the revolution in their own country. They offer to bestow their services gratis. We certainly are not ripe for a seminary: it would take some years before we shall have scholars far enough advanced to profit by this generous offer. I shall hear from them in answer to the letter I shall send tomorrow. On Saturday, I propose going to Bury for two days.

They are not catalogued and are referred to in these pages simply as S tony hurst Transcripts .', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 197 There is no mention of restoration plans in this letter, tout in that of September 7, 1790, to the same correspondent, he says: ""I received a letter last night from our worthy Mr. Francis Neale, who continues in his old stile to urge the re-establishment in spite of every prudential reason against the attempt, till Divine Providence opens a better pros- pect."" 28 A week later, he informed Plowden oí the contents! of Thorpe\'s letter from Rome (August 21, 1790), since ""it chiefly turns on the subject of Cardinal Antonelli being haunted with the fears of the revival of the Society in America. I think it is providential that his alarms have been raised since the issuing of the bulls for erecting the See of Baltimore. I suspect otherwise it would have been re- fused. I shall now write to the Cardinal in plain language on the subject."" 29 Cardinal Antonelli\'s fear was aroused by the calumnies of Fathers Poterie and Smyth, and it isi for this reason that Carroll tells the head of the Sacred Con- gregation (Sept. 27, 1790) that since his appointment aã Prefect-Apostolic of the United States (1784) he had com- missioned thirty priests for the work of the American mis- sions ; seven of these only were ex- Jesuits, and twe\'nty-three non-Jesuits.30 The financial affairs of the Society, before the Suppres- sion were regulated for England and the American colonies through the English Provincial\'s hands, and while in Lon- don, Father Strickland and Bishop Carroll signed a joint memorandum adjusting their mutual claims.31 Apart from his interest in the Catholic Committee\'s ac- tivities Bishop Carroll found his time rather well taken up in writing appeals to wealthy Catholic noblemen of England 28 S tony hurst Transcripts. 29 Hughes, /. c., p. 688. 30 Ibid.

On his return to the United States, the two educational projects - Georgetown and St. Mary\'s Seminary - gave him little opportunity to be troubled over the revival of the Society, and with the grant of the charter for the Corporation (December, 1792), he no doubt felt that the old Jesuit properties would be suffi- ciently protected without a restoration. The next General Chapter, held at Whitemarsh (November 7, 1792) was at- tended by twenty-two priests, four of whom were non- Jesuits, but nothing seems to have been done in the matter of the restoration. The main resolutions passed refer to the support of Georgetown and the Seminary. Subsequent meetings of the Select Body of the Clergy, which directed the use of the ex-Jesuit estates, and the correspon- dence between Rome and Baltimore, were silent on the question of the Society\'s revival until 1795, when apparently the Select Board passed a formal resolution to the effect\' that the Holy See was to be asked to reestablish the Society of Jesus in the United States. Among the Shea Transcripts at Georgetown there is a copy of an "" imperfect manuscript of Dr. Carroll on the Restoration of the Society of Jesus "" in which Bishop Carroll says : "" I have devoted much time to the consideration of the subject recommended to me by some of our Brethren whom I greatly respect, and latterly by the Trustees who were assembled at the Marsh, 1795. This subject is an application to His Holiness for a revival of the Society in the United States."" Dr. Carroll then dis- cusses the precautions necessary in approaching the subject, and though the measure is a highly desirable one, he con- fesses : ""I am far from an intimate conviction that any considerable advantage would be derived from the reappear- 82 A list of these benefactions will be found in Hughes, /. c ., p. 690, note 12.', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 199 ance of the Society with a mutilated and defective Constitu- tion, instead of that one, compleat in all its parts, by which the Jesuits were formerly governed. Indeed, I should have fears that such a restitution might be of prejudice by pre- venting a full and entire one, in some later period/\' 8* That Dr. Carroll was justified in these prudent views is borne out by the failure of the pseudo-Jesuit Society, then established in France, under the name of Paccanarists. The general status of the Society at the opening of the century was greatly changed by the Pontifical Brief Catho - licae Fidei , of March 7, 1801, granting a legal or canonical existence to the Order as a body in Russia, with the sin- gular privilege of aggregating members from any part of the world.94 The Russian Province now had a General of the Society at its head in the person of Father Gabriel Cruber (10 Oct., 1802 - April 7, 1805), and it was evident to the Catholic world that the full and "" compleat "" reap- pearance of the Society was but a question of time. It was the long captivity of the Pope at Savona which prevented the canonical restoration of the Society before his freedom in 1814. Father Thomas Hughes rightfully sees a pro- vidential action in the partial restoration of the Jesuits in the United States in 1806; for, when the general revival came in 1814, only one Jesuit of the old veteran members of 1773, was alive - Father Charles Neale. The year previous to the Russian restoration, Bishop Carroll had entered into negotiations with Prince Charlesi de Broglie and Abbé Rozaven, the leaders of the Society of the Fathers of the Faith, commonly known as Paccanar- ists. Among the many attempts made to revive the rule and the aims of the Society of Jesus during the Interim 88 Cited by Hughes, L c ., p. 818, note 13u 84 Carroll received this intelligence from Father Strickland in a letter dated London, September 29, 1801. ( Baltimore Cathedral Archives, Case 8-D2.)', ""200 American Catholic Historical Society (1773-1814) two only were blessed with some measure of success. The first of these was the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, founded by two young Seminarists of St. Sulpice (Paris) who had taken refuge in Belgium during the French Revolution - François Eleanor de Tournely and Prince Charles de Broglie, a son of the famous Marshal, Prince de Broglie. They set up a novitiate near Louvain, where they were joined by several brilliant young army- officers, notably, Joseph Varin. In 1794, they were forced to flee from Belgium at the advance of the French army, but during the wanderings of the little community, studies were kept up and several of their members were ordained. A final stand was made at Hagebrunn, near Vienna, in 1797, and Father Varin was chosen Superior. Meanwhile, at Rome, Nicholas Paccanari, a native of Valsugnana, near Trent, had founded a similar community, under the title, the Company of the Faith of Jesus. This second Society proved attractive to many of the ex-Jesuits, and a fusion with the French Society of the Sacred Heart was pro- posed and effected in 1790. Paccanari, then only a tonsured cleric, was elected Superior-General of the united com- munity, henceforth known as the Fathers of the Faith. In 1800, Fathers De Broglie and Rozaven were sent to Eng- land in quest of subjects. The Fathers of the Faith at thiä time numbered about 150 members. As has been seen, among the ex- Jesuits who joined the new community was Father Forrester, the master of ceremonies at Carroll's con- secration, but Father Charles Plowden was in the beginning as strongly opposed to a partial restoration of the Society's Constitutions and Rule, as Bishop Carroll was. Abbé de Broglie opened a school in Kensington, London, but he came to grief in 1805. Paccanari himself proved to be somewhat of an adventurer, and disappeared in 1809. Almost all the Fathers of the Faith entered either the Rus- sian Province of the Society of Jesus before 1814, or the restored Society after its revival."", 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 201 Fathers Rozaven and De Broglie wrote to Bishop Carroll on July 4, 1800, telling him of the creation of an English Province of the Fathers of the Faith, with Father Rozaven as Provincial, and urging the American ex-Jesuits to join the new community. They offered their services in the missions and especially in the work of teaching at George- town. Bishop Carroll and his coadjutor, Bishop-elect Neale, replied (October 27, 1800), accepting with gratitude the proposal made, and they asked that one or two of the Fathers well versed in philosophy and especially in natural philosophy and mathematics, and not ignorant of English, be sent out from England to Georgetown, where a hearty welcome would be given them. Besides these, the Mis- sions needed two or three good priests, especially those who knew German. On this same day, Bishop Carroll wrote to Father Strickland, saying that money would be forthcom- ing for the expenses of the journey of "" one or two pro- fessors of philosophy for Georgetown College."" Further details of this attempt of the Paccanarists to make a begin- ning in the United States, are given in Carroll\'s letter to Plowden, under date of Decemer 15, 1800: Since the receipt of your last, as I probably mentioned to you in June, I received and answered a letter from London, sent to me by Messrs. de Broglie and Rosaven. They gave the outlines of their institute, and its acceptance by the late and present pope. I can entertain no doubt of the zeal and sound principles of this new body of recruits to the church, of which I have heard much from other quarters; therefore have requested them to send two of their Society to this country, where they will learn in the space of a few months, much more concerning the probability and means of forming establishments here, than can be learned by twenty letters. Their place is, I hope the work of God, tho\' in one point they have departed from S. Ignatius, viz : that of engrafting on their institution a new order of nuns, to be under the government', '202 American Catholic Historical Society of the Superiors of their own Society. I should be glad to hear of the manner of their reception in England and success there. Mr. Stone, to whom I send my best respects, will receive a letter signed by some of our Brethren, amongst whom is Dns. Doyne, concerning this application to me from these two Dele- gates of the Society of the Faith of Jesus. They (our Breth- ren) met together without a general concert of the rest of us, and full of zeal for the re-establishment of the Society, have written as if that happy event were already effected, and I have seen a letter from one of those, who attended that meet- ing, in which, to the signature of his name, he adds the word, Soc. I . This is going too fast for one who subscribed his submission to the operation of the destructive Brief. In mine to MM.

The leaders of the Fathers of the Faith were then assured that they would find the American ex-Jesuits ready for union. Dr. Carroll objected to this proceeding because all the Jesuits were not represented, and because he feared, as he ss S tony hurst Transcripts. 36 A digest of this letter is in Hughes, /. c.f p. 761.', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 203 had said before, any hasty action which might endanger the general restoration of the Society. A year apparently went by before anything further was done, though we find on October 19, 1801, Bishop Neale giving way to a spirit of discouragement in a letter to Father Stone, then President of Stonyhurst College : "" All the members of the Society here are now grown old, the young- est being past 54. Death therefore holds out his threaten- ing rod, and excites us to redoubled wishes for the re-estab- lishment of the Society, on which the welfare of this country seems much to depend."" 37 When the news came of the pontifical approval given to the Society in Russia (1801), hopes were immediately aroused by the little rem- nant of the Jesuits here that they might be canonically ag- gregated to that Province. On March 12, 1802, Dr. Car- roll tells Father Plowden that he had heard of the Russian restoration : "" I beg you to send me, as early as possible, all the authentic information on this subject of which you are in possession.""®8 Father Strickland had already sent the news, however, for on April 21, 1802, Bishop Neale wrote to Stone: ""We have heard of the reestablishment of the Society thro\' Mr. Strickland. But the clear light does not yet shine on us. . . . Anything genuine from our ancient body would be highly gratifying."" 39 The Americans seem to have been left in the dark for a long time. Bishop Neale was constantly being importuned by the old Jesuits to ob- tain exact information of their status, and he wrote to Stone (June 30, 1802) : ""For God\'s sake relieve me from my 37 Hughes, /. c., p. 761.

These letters also contain the English attitudtì towards Borgia\'s opposition to the aggregation with Russia.', '204 American Catholic Historical Society distressed situation."" Finally, on August 30, 1802, seven of the American ex- Jesuits met at Newtown and sent a joint letter to the two Bishops, asking that they write at once to the General of the Sociey in Russia, "" in our behalf to inform him of our wish to be reinstated."" They desired also information regarding the status of the ex-Jesuit pro- perties, and they asked for an authentic copy of the Catho- licae Fidei. The appointment of a Visitor or Commissary- General, to be sent from Russia or England, was likewise urged. Thosej wh!o signed this Petition were: Fathers Charles Neale, James Walton, John Bolton, Ignatius Baker Brook, Charles Sewall, Robert Molyneux, and Sylvester Boarman. But direct communication with Father-General Gruber, in Russia, was very difficult, owing to the disturbed condition of affairs in Europe. The Paccanarist movement died out in the United States as quickly as it began. One of the Fathers of the Faith, Rev. Nicholas Zocchi, arrived here about this time. He had gone first to Canada, but the government there would not permit him to remain, and he came to Baltimore.40 Dr. Carroll says of him in a letter to Plowden (February 12, 1803:) "" One of their [Paccanarist] body is now here, Romano di nascita , his name Zocchi. He went from Eng- land to Canada but the rigor of government there allows not of any foreign Catholic clergymen settling in it; he therefore came hither, but being of a narrow understanding, he does nothing but pine for the arrival of his brethren, and in the meantime will undertake no service. From this sample of the new order, I am induced to believe that they are very little instructed in the maxims or Institute of our venerable mother, the Society. Tho\' they profess to have no other rules than ours, he seems to me to know nothing of the structure of our Society, nor even to have read the 40 Archiépiscopal Archives of Quebec , Halifax Mss., 4.106.', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 205 regulae communes , which our very novices knew almost by heart."" 41 From this time forward, all hopes for restoration were centered on Russia. "" It was a period of great anxiety and perplexity,"" says Shea, "" in which neither Dr. Carroll nor his pious coadjutor, Bishop Neale, could see his way clearly. They wrote to Father Gabriel Gruber, General of the Jesuits in Russia. \' We who write this letter to your Paternity were formerly of the Society of Jesus and the Province of England. After the fell destruction of the Society in 1773, we returned to this our native land, and have labored in it together with fellow-members of our Society, ours being* the only Catholic priests who have labored for the salvation of souls since the first entrance of Christians into these lands.\' They then detailed the erection of the Diocese of Baltimore and the influx of other priests. The fourteen surviving members of the Society, most of them broken by years and toil, remained chiefly in the two States of Mary- land and Pennsylvania, in which was the oldest and most powerful residence of Catholics. They state how joyously they had learned of the preservation of the Society in Rus- sia, and the permission given him by a Papal brief to enroll1 again in the Society those who had f ormerly been: members. \' Wherefore most of them solicit with ardent desire, that by renewing the same vows, which they had vowed to God in the Society of Jesus, they may be permitted to end their days in its bosom ; and if it can be done by the will of Pro- vidence, spend the remainder of their lives in restoring the Society among us. You know, Very Rev. Father, what and how much must be done that not a mere larva of the old Society, but its genuine form, the rule, and proper spirit may revive in them all/ To effect this the two bishops asked: 1. Whether the Sovereign Pontiff had per- 41 Stonyhurst Transcripts.', '2 o6 American Catholic Historical Society mitted the erection of the Society elsewhere than in Russia, by an authentic brief or bull. 2. Whether the Pope per- mitted only the former members to re-enter, or authorized the reception of new members. 3. What probation was to precede the restoration of former members. 4. How dele- gates were to be chosen to the General Congregation. They urged him to select some Father of great prudence, exper- ience in the direction of affairs, and deeply imbued with the spirit of Saint Ignatius, to come over, with such powers of a Visitor as the holy founder conferred on Saint Francis Borgia and others, and effect the restoration. They did not consider any one of the Fathers in America eligible, as they had been absorbed in missionary duty and had enjoyed little leisure to study the Constitutions and the acts of the General Congregations. If no one in England could be found, they preferred an Italian or a German. The bishops stated that the property formerly belonging to the Society had been nearly all preserved, and was sufficient to maintain at least thirty Fathers; and that part of it had been employed in founding a College for the education of young men. They further mentioned their own elevation to the episcopate and the freedom enjoyed by Catholics, under which there was no obstacle to religious orders ; and closed by expressing their fervent wish that some hope and beginning of the restoration of the Society may result from their correspond- ence.""42 Another year was to pass before an answer to this letter reached the United States. Meanwhile, the Society re- ceived partial restoration in England, having been aggre- 42 Shea, op. cit ., vol. ii, pp. 517-519, cited from the Woodstock Letters, vol. iv, p. 73. (Cf.

The present writer found it impossible to obtain permission to secure a complete set of the Woodstock Letters, but was fortunate in being able to consult them in a library abroad. (References to the Letters are not given, since in most cases the original documents are cited.', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 207 gated to Russia, by Father Gruber in 1803, and after the opening of the regular novitiate at Hodder, it is easy to re- cognize Charles Plowden\'s fine hand in effecting a similar restoration in the United States.451 The long delay in hear- ing from Russia influenced some to consider the advisability of joining the English Province, then under Father Stone, as Superior. Georgetown College was not flourishing, and it was evident that it would continue to show signs of de- cline under Bishop Neale\'s direction. \'The only hope of saving the institution was to place it in the hands of the Society, whose estates had helped so considerably in building1 and equipping it, and if the ex- Jesuits here could count upon help from Stonyhurst, they would willingly join the English Province. The situation was also clouded by the fact that Father Emery had recalled the Sulpicians.

The school for boys erected there (St. Mary\'s College), to the great pre- judice of George Town College, still exists; but as the Spanish youths, their chief support, are ordered by their Government to return immediately to their native country, it must naturally fall to nothing.

One of them is the duplicate of another writ- ten in May last, to which no answer is yet received; and fear- ful of miscarriage by the way of Hamburg, to which the first copy was to have been sent, I take the liberty of inclosing these to you, and requesting the Geni, to send his answers thro' you. This I was induced to do; after hearing of the station, in which you are placed, and chosen by providence, as it may reasonably be hoped, to revive the spirit and renew the usefulness of the Society. The letters inclosed express the wishes of some of our former Brethren and of several others, priests and non-priests to be re-admitted, and first ad- mitted into it. Being here on a visitation, I have only time to add, that the vessel is sailing, that I hope you will charge the postage on this and similar occasions to my account with Thos.

In the meanwhile I commit the whole to the favor, zeal, and patronage of yourself, Most Illustrious and Reverend Lord and your coadjutor the Bishop of Gortyna. If you both consider that it will be easy to communicate with Father Stone, the Provincial of England, let ours turn to him for the necessary government. If Father Stone is too distant, inform me, and propose some one of our Fathers in America whom I can appoint Pro- vincial.

Gruber, that I have not yet received any letter from him, tho' one is expected impatiently by many of our Brethren. But even when his answer arrives, unless it presents the reestablish- ment of the Society in a view different from any that I have yet seen, it will, in my opinion, be very unsafe to enter into any engagement in it, at least so as to divest ones-self of the means of living independent, if after abdicating one's property another Pope should declare the re-establishment in virtue of a mere verbal promise, void, and contrary to Ecclesiastical institu- tions, and especially so in countries where it had been abolished in virtue of a brief, accepted and intimated by the first pastors, and submitted to expressly, tho' most unwillingly, by the mem- bers of the Society then living. But if the members of the Society, before their profession do not abdicate their property, they will not be truly religious, nor most assuredly Jesuits, according to the standard of St. Ignatius - I cannot even con- ceive, how there can be any professi quatuor votorum in the present state of things, for reasons which it is unnecessary toi mention to any one, who like you, remember the principles of our Theology concerning the difference between the dissolu- bility of solemn and simple vows. However, I hope sincerely that the Pope will soon be so unfettered, as to be able to issue in full and authentic form a bull or brief for the re-establish- ment. In this hope I am encouraged by a letter from Rome, received since I wrote the first lines of this; and the more so as it does not come from one of our former Brethren who are easily led to hope, what they ardently wish; but from a Dominican of note and character there, Fr. Concanen. You mention Fr. Angiolini's mission to Naples, only as a rumor, of which you expected a confirmation but Fr. Concanen says positively, that he was lately gone from Rome to that city to settle the four Houses granted by the king to the Jts : that an edict had been issued there in 1787 withdrawing all Regulars from any subjection to Generals or Superiors living out of the Kingdom; that Angiolini insisted on the necessity of preserv- ing the Institute inviolate, and consequently of the Jesuits re-"", 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 21 v cognizing Fr.

No answer had come by December 7, 1804, as Carroll states in a letter to Father Plowden, and he gives his opinion quite emphatically that he is not satisfied with the viva voce method of being restored to the Society : "" I would neither trust to it myself or advise others to do so; in which opinion I am confirmed the more, by knowing that His Holiness either will not or dares not to exert authority enough to prevent Cardinal Borgia from writing such a letter to Your W. AA., as is mentioned by Mr. Stone. ... So much mystery has been made of all proceedings concerning it [the Restoration ], that every one is full of distrust, to which the general state of religion and the influence enjoyed by its greatest foes contributes in great measure."" Again, in this same letter he speaks of Molyneux\' disapproval of the secretive meas- ures adopted by the English Jesuits. "" Robert is not pleased with the secrecy which prevails with your principal people in the transactions relative to the Society. In general, I do not approve of the system of conducting without any communication the affairs concerning so small a body as the remnant of the Society in England ; but, at the same time, it is reasonable to suppose, that there is good cause for it, and it wtxuld be very rash for any one, at my distance, to blame a conduct, of which he cannot know the motives. 48 5"" tony hurst T r ans crip ts.', '212 American Catholic Historical Society Your Br\'s. sound sense, great virtues, and steady attachment to the Society are a sure warrant of his acting on principle, and I have no doubt of others acting equally so, tho\' they agree not on the means. My greatest objections to a de- pendence on a vivae vocis oraculum (a modern phrase un- known for many centuries), is, that it gives no stability toi a religious order; that cannot abrogate a public and acknow- ledged instrument, such as the brief of destruction ; and that without an authentic bull of approbation of the Institute, the distinction of simple & solemn vows, so essential to the Society, does not exist according to the doctrine of our Divines, after Suarez."" Acting on Father Gruber\' s letter of aggregation, Bishop Carroll, on June 21, 1805, the Feast of St. Aloysius Gon- zaga, appointed Father Robert Molyneux Superior of the restored Society of Jesus in the United States. Rev. and Dear Sir, You know the purport of the letter, which I received from! the very Rev. Fr. Gabriel Gruber, Gen. of the Society in Russia. Messrs. Bolton and Brooke have likewise informed you of the proceedings had thereupon at St. Thomas\'s. Toi give life and vigor to the measures recommended by the! Geni, it seemed necessary to begin with that exercise of power, with which I was entrusted by his Paternity ; that is, the ap- pointment of a Superior, to be one of the former body of the Society, and a candidate for readmission. His authority will last till the General\'s will be further declared. I am therefore now to make known to you, that you are appointed to that office; and, as no special form of appointment was made use of by the General in delegating to me his power for nominating a Superior, I am to presume that nothing more than his notification is requisite to invest you for the present with all the rights and privileges, power and authority, where- with the Provincials of the Society were formerly invested; which rights, power and authority are to appertain to you, till the Geni, shall otherwise ordain. Of this appointment notice', ""Restoration of Jesuits in United States 213 will be sent hence to George Town and S. Thomas's.

Its situation was of course a differ- ent one from that which had existed in the old days (1634- I773)> when the nearest juridic power was the English Provincial across the sea. It was indeed a novel situation - one to which the veterans in the restored Society were un- accustomed ; but even under an easy-going and rather inac- tive leader like Molyneux, the restored Society soon took up its old Rule and religious life. There was bound to be friction over the transfer of the ex-Jesuit properties, but during the episcopate of Carroll and Neale, no seriousi variance of opinion caused any dissension to arise. Ini fact, as we read in Carroll's letter to Stone (August 1803). 49 Hughes, I . c., p. 820. Father Molyneux is occasionally spoken of as Provincial. He was only Superior of the affiliated American Jesuits. When he died on December 9, 1808, Father Charles Neale became Superior, and on October 1, 1812, Neale was superseded by Father Kohlmann, who resigned in 1812, to be succeeded by Fatheťi John Grassi. In 1817, Father Grassi was followed by Kohlmann, andí on November 15, 1821, 'Charles Neale again became Superior. He wasl succeeded by Father Dzierozynski, on August 13, 1823, and in Nov- ember, 1830, Father Kenney was placed in charge of the American Jesuits. It was only in 1833 that the Province was erected, with Father* William McSherry as first Provincial. These dates are taken from a letter to B. U. Campbell by Father George Fenwick, dated Octoberl 12, 1855, in the Baltimore Cathedral Archives , Special C, D-8. Thel ratification of Molyneux's appointment by Brzozowski is in an official letter to Carroll from the Father General, dated February 22, 1806. (Ibid., Case 2-C 2)."", '214 American Catholic Historical Society the two bishops had seriously considered whether they should not resign their Sees (Baltimore and Gortyna) and resume their former state in the Society. They were held back, fortunately, by the îealization that the Diocese might be entrusted to one who was opposed to the general restora- . tion of the Society of Jesus. No one realized more pro- foundly than Carroll the great boon to religion the Society would be. His old fears, however, crowded around him, for it was one thing to have the Society restored, and quite another to have its membership made up of vigorous, able and learned men.50 Only three of the former members had resumed their status at this time - Molyneux, Charles Sewall, and Charles Neale. Bishop Carroll liked Moly- neux ; he had lived with Sewall at St. Peter\'s Pro-Cathedral from 1786-1807; and he had experienced the peculiar bent of Charles Neale\' s character in several matters of import- ance, particularly in his influence over the Carmelite nuns at Port Tobacco. But he had no illusions about any of these men. Of Molyneux, he wrote to Plowden, at the time of the former\'s death (December 9, 1808) : ""About the beginning of last December, I advised you of the ap- prehension I was then under, of daily hearing of the death of our old, good, and much respected friend, Mr. Robt. 50 The Father-General wrote to Carroll, on June 9, 1836 ( Baltimore Cathedral Archives , Case 2-C 3), telling him he need not be troubled over Propaganda\'s attitude towards the American restoration - "" dé internis Praetor iron judicat ! he writes. Again, on August 9, 1807, Brzozowski wrote to Carroll about his great hopes for the American branch of the Society; the novices were to be placed in the care of the wisest of the new members, and the "" doors were to be opened wide "" to receive all who wished to join the Society (Ibid., Case 2-C 4). The opinion of Father ¡Strickland on Propaganda\'s attitude is expressed in a letter to Carroll, dated London, December 16, 1808 (Ibid., case 8-C 3) - "" Propaganda is a public tribunal and could not accept the vivaĄ vocis oraculum f but would have to have official documents of a legal value ; moreover, if Propaganda recognized the Society, certain proper- ties which the ISacred Congregation has confiscated, would have to be restored, particularly in the East.""', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 215 Molyneux, which event took place at Georgetown on the 9th of that month, after his being prepared by a life of candor, virtue and innocence, and by all those helps, which are mercifully ordained for the comfort and advantage of de- parting Christians.

The six priests were admitted into the Select Body of thd Clergy on September 1, 1807 (Hughes, op. cit., Documents , vol. i, part ii, p. 871). This action was nullified by the Corporation on May 12, 1808, on the ground that the six priiests were foreigners, and as isuch were not recognized as beneficiaries by the Maryland laws. It would be asking too much of the American ex- Jesuits to have been thoroughly in harmony with these new foreign members of the revived- Society. Grassi, in his Memorie, tells us that many of those who joined the American Jesuits at this period (1805-1817) were former members of other religious Orders (pp. 33-37). These priests were immediately', ""2i6 American Catholic Historical Society The danger of a conflict over property rights and transfer was avoided by an agreement signed by Carroll and Moly- neux (September 20, 1805) whereby under certain condi- tions the Society re-entered into possession of the old estates some of which dated back to the time of the early Calverts. Bishop Carroll was to receive an annuity, allotted to him from the estates, which were to remain perpetual and inalien- able,53 This arrangement lasted until the time of Maréchal, when around it was centered for a time a notorious con- troversy, the last echoes of which do not seem yet to have died away. The eminent Sulpician, Father Anthony Gamier, who had returned to France in 1803, with characteristic bonhomie wrote to Bishop Carroll about this time (January 17, 1806) : Je vous fais bien sincèrement mon compliment de rétab- lissement de la très sainte et très utile Compagnie de Jésus dans votre diocèse. C'est elle qui1 la première a jeté le fonde- ment de la foi dans vos contrées, c'est à elle qu'il appartient de l'établir et de le consolider.

Father-General Brzozowiski wrote to Carroll from Russia on August 18, 1808, con- gratulating him on the division of the Diocese of Baltimore and re- getting that the troubled condition of Europe had prevented him from sending more Jesuits to the American group ( Baltimore Cathedral Archives, Case 2-C 5). 58 These articles of agreement will be found in Hughes, /. c., pp. 929-930. The two parties agreed that the properties had now been vested in the restored Society, that Carroll's annuity as Superior, that is, as Bishop, would continue, and that the said annuity should bei attached in perpetuity to the See of Baltimore. 54 Georgetown College Archives , Shea Collection , printed in Hughes, /. c.y p. 822 note."", 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 217 tion even, who would obey in the simplicity of their sanctity the voice of the Superior who should send them out to con- vert the world in the name of Christ - required the very thing Bishop Carroll feared could not then be given, namely that special training in the novitiate in which the true fol- lower of St. Ignatius Loyola is formed to the Founder\'s spirit and ideal. The condition of the little band who had set their hands to the task of bringing life back to the Society was a lame and crippled one, and the commencement of the business, - to use Charles Sewall\'s phrase - was "" perfectly awkward."" A novitiate was opened at George- town with Father Charles Neale, as Novice-Master, and Car- roll accounts in his letter of April 2, 1806, to Strickland, for eleven novices, scholastics, and lay coadjutors. Amongst the novices and scholastics there were some young men of brilliant talents. When Father Molyneux, the first Superior was dying (December 8, 1808) he named Charles Neale as Superior and Father-General Brzozowski 55 confirmed this appointment, making him Superior on September 13, 1809. If we are to accept the word of Father John Grassi, whose Memoir on the restored Society of Jesus in the United States (1810-1817) is one of the literary sources for this period, there never had been a strong bond of affection be- tween Bishop Carroll and Charles Neale, and considerable friction seems to have arisen between them ( 1808) owing to the Jesuit Superior\'s action in removing at will the priests! who belonged to his community. Strictly speaking, if the Society in the United States had been given full canonical existence in 1806, as it was in 1814, Father Neale was within his rights in using his subjects to what he considered the 65 Father-General Gruber died on April 7, 1805, according to Broz- ozowski- letter to Carroll, May 12, 1805 ( Baltimore Cathedral Archives, Case I-P 3). Father-General Brzozowski\'® appointment is mentioned in a letter to Carroll from Strickland, November 4, 1805 (Ibid., Casa 8-D 6), who added in a postscript: ""How to pronounce his name, I know not ! ""', ""2i8 American Catholic Historical Society best advantage. But during those eight years of its private ( fora interno) re-establishment, Archbishop Carroll could not help taking offense at actions which objectively at least were a derogation of his episcopal jurisdiction. Apologiesi were made to the Metropolitan of Baltimore by Brzozowski, who also wrote a warning letter to Neale, and later relieved him of his post to make way for Father John Grassi, S. J., who had arrived in 181 1. The point at issue was, however, something more important than mere personal dislike, which Carroll certainly had for Charles Neale. It was the regula- tion passed by the Bishops in the Meeting of 1810 regarding priests who are members of secular or regular Congrega- tions; namely, that once they have been entrusted to the care of souls in a specified locality, they ought not to be re- called against the will of the Bishop. This was a protective measure highly necessary in the condition of the 'Church here, where priests were so few in number. It was Neale' s imprudent use of his powers as Superior in removing Father Adam Britt, S. J., from Holy Trinity Church, Philadelphia, which finally aroused Carroll and caused him to write to the Father-General suggesting that some one else be ap- pointed as Jesuit Superior in the United States.59 Father Brzozowski's letter (November 20, 181 1) relieving Neale and. appointing Grassi, says that Father Kohlmann would have been given the post, but that he was needed in New York. The most remarkable of the Jesuits sent from Europe by the General was Father Anthony Kohlmann, whose career in America and in Europe as a teacher and missionary places him above all who belonged to the American Province dur- ing his time here. Bishop Carroll quickly saw the brilliant 56 The Britt- Carroll correspondence will be found in the Baltimore Cathedral Archives, 'Case 2- A 1-18.

When Bishop Concanen advised Archbishop Car- roll of his inability to set out for America, Father Kohlmann was sent to New York as Administrator and Vicar General during the interim, which lasted until Bishop Connolly\'s arrival in 181 5."" Here in 1808-09 he began a classical school, called the New York Literary Institute, on the pre- sent site of St. Patrick\'s Cathedral. His stay in» New York is equally remarkable for the famous decision in a confes- sional case, to the effect that confessions of penitents were inviolable and could not be revealed in court.68 In 1815, Father Kohlmann returned to Georgetown and became Master of Novices. Two years later he was appointed Superior, and in 1824 when the Gregorian University was reopened in Rome, he was recalled to take the chair of dogmatic theology. One of his pupils was Joachim Pecci, later Leo XIII. He died in Rome on April 11, 1836. The imprisonment of Pope Pius VII and the partial dis- organization of business routine at Rome, together with the blockade of European ports and the War of 1812 between England and the United States, caused an almost complete stoppage of letters at this time; in a way, this was not an evil to the Church in America, or to the restored Society. The leaders, the priests and the laymen who were officials! in Church temporalities, were thus thrown upon their own resources, and were forced to fight their way through diffi- culties which outside advice or guidance might only have made more complicated and, perhaps, insoluble. 57 Baltimore Cathedral Archives , Case 2-C 7. 58 Sampson, The Catholic Question in America (New York, 1813), contains in an appendix the report of this first legal tilt over the seal of the confessional.

Carroll writes to Plowden, on December 12, 1813 : "" Mr. Grassi has revived the College of G. Town which has received great improvement in the number of students, and course of studies. His predecessor (Father Francis Neale, S. J.) with the same good intentions had no ability for his station, and was nominated by a strange com- bination. There are, I think, nine or ten novices under a Fr. Beschter of Flanders, a very holy man, but one, in whom the want of a regular education in the Society is very discernible."" 59 The Novitiate was removed from Georgetown to St. Inigoes, in 1812. The danger of British invasion and other reasons led the Fathers to prepare the house at Whitemarsh for the novices.60 The White- marsh plantation had been placed under the care of Father Germain Bitouzey, in 1801. Father Bitouzey soon ac- quired considerable influence in the Corporation of the Clergy, being elected one of the Trustees (1802). He had little love for the leaders of the American Jesuits, whom he contemptuously referred to as "" the Russians "", and the Society found it difficult to induce him to give up the Whitemarsh plantation. Bitouzey\' s letters are filled with indignation against the restored Society and he refused to yield possession of Whitemarsh on the score that the Society had not been reestablished in the United States.61 Bishop Carroll realized the unpleasant effect not only of 59 S tony hurst Transcripts. 60 Cf.

Charles and Robt. Plowden. All of these contain a mortuary list of our Brethren, but nothing of Mr. Strick- land, which encourages me to hope, not only that he lives, but likewise so as to enjoy comfort, to continue, to a certain degree, his accustomed usefulness. On the subject, about which you were pleased to advise with me, I presume, that our friends in England are precisely in the same state, as we are here ; that is, that nothing has been done for annulling and repealing the destroying Brief of Clement 14th. with equal authority, publicity and authenticity ; as was given to that Pontiff's act, which had its full execution in all countries where it was published. Even the members of the Society, namely those at Liège, in Flanders, in England and here entered their free, tho certainly reluctant submission to it. Reviewing the severe injunctions contained in the Brief, the censures on the Ordinaries, who allow, and the individuals who attempt its violation, it seems to me, that without a dero- gation from it by an act of equal authority, and quite as authen- tic; those, who with you and us, bind themselves by vow to live under the obedience of the Geni, in Russia, or to conform to the rules of the Society, will nor can be a religious body, or enjoy the privileges of such. Their sacrifice is highly meri- torious before God, but in the face of the Church, those, who enter into Orders, and those who are already in them, must! be subject to the general discipline as to their title for ordina- tion, and be, as secular priests under the authority of the Bishops. This has been declared by Fr. Czerniewiez, in his letter to Mr. Jn. Howard at Liège, Fr. Gruber and the present Geni., in their communications to me, copy of which would now be forwarded, if I were not confident that you have re- ceived such already. Tho these restraints diminish much the usefulness of our Dear Brethren, and may discourage some from making the sacrifice mentioned above, yet it is a mis-"", ""Restoration of Jesuits in United States 223 fortune, to which submission is due, as long as it pleases God to keep us under it, which I trust will not be long. This matter has often engaged my very serious attention, and caused me to refer to the authorities of the ablest Divines, from whom many extracts were occasionally made to aid my judgment. I have sometimes hoped, that these researches would lead to a different conclusion, but I am sorry to say that they all ended in confirming the opinion already expressed. Wherever the Brief was executed, the Society was extin- guished; and to revive it, the same authority was requisite, as for the creation and approbation of a new Order. In Rus- sian Poland, the Brief was not executed by the competent authority. But where fresh authority has not been authen- tically exercised, I cannot reconcile with the doctrine of ouť Divines, how the difference between simple and solemn vows, can be established ; how any who embrace the Society here or in England can be Professi quattuor votorum ; and consequently, how the Society can exist, unless there be professed Frs. What must then be the meaning of that part of the first vows, pro - mitto eandem Societatem me ingressurum etc? With these impressions on my mind and the recollection of the solemn orders of his Holiness contained in the Briefs for my Con- secration, the erection of this, and other Episcopal Sees in the United States, my obligation to be subject to the commands of Congn de Propgda fide etc. I never could persuade myself to admit that our young men, who associate themselves to the Society, can be admitted to Orders, titulo religionis : they are ordained titulo missionis under the authority of the Ordinary - As long as I and my Coadjutor, Bishop Neale continue alive, there will be little or no inconvenience; for we shall always act in harmony with the Superior of the Society ; but in Eng- land I am sensible that this must be a disagreeble situation.64 During Father Grassi' s Rectorship the College was raised by an Act of Congress to the rank of a University (March I, 1815), and from his day down to the present, it has never 64 S tony hurst Transcripts."", ""224 American Catholic Historical Society lost its place of eminence in the educational life of the United States. Father Grassi returned to Rome in 1817, succeeding to high posts in the Society, among which was the Rectorship of the Collegio Urbano. He died at Rome, December 12, 1849. On December 7, 1814, Archbishop Carroll had the hap- piness of receiving a copy of the Bull Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum (August 7, 1814) which restored in full can- onical form the Society of Jesus throughout the world. That night he dispatched it to Father Grassi, at George- town. Laudemus Deum et exultemus in eo, Carroll wrote to Grassi on December 10-11, 1814.64 It was the end of all of his fears that the partial re-establishment in Russia, the Two Sicilies, England and America would not last, and in a pardonable burst of enthusiasm he proposed to the Jesuit superior the rather impractical suggestion of a meet- ing between the Ordinaries of the United States and the head of the Society of Jesus here. He proposed also to publish a Pastoral to the Catholics of the United States, calling to their attention the profound meaning of the mem- orable event. Many eloquent pages of jubilation weire written by the members of the Society during these last weeks of the old year 1814. Dr. Carroll's letter to) Father Plowden on receiving an authentic copy (January 5, 1815) of the Sollicitudo reflects the joy felt in the United States at the news of the Restoration : My dear and respected Sir , Your most precious and grateful favour of Octr. 8th ac- companied by a copy of the bull of restoration was received early in Deer., and diffused the greatest sensation of joy and thanksgiving not only amongst the surviving and new members of the Society, but also all good Christians, who have any re- 65 Cf.

You, who know Rome, may conceive my sensations, when I read the account transmitted in your most pleasing letter, of the celebration and mass by his Holiness himself at the superb altar of St. Ign. at the Gesù; the assemblage of the surviving Jesuits in the Chapel to hear the proclamation of their resurrection ; the decree for the restitution of the residence in life and the scene of the death of their Patriarch of the Novitiate of S. Andrew, its most en- chanting church, and the lovely monument and chapel of S. Stanislaus, which I fondly hope have escaped the fangs of rapine and devastation. Is there no hope, that these acts of justice and religion will be followed by the restoration like- wise of the Roman College, the magnificent Church of S. Ignatius, and the wonderful monument of S. Aloysius? If as I believe, these were appropriated not to private uses, but became the public University of the City and Diocese of Rome, they will be restored to their former owners with less difficulty. But how many years must pass before these houses will be repeopled by such men as we have known and whom sanctity of manner, zeal for the divine glory, science, eloquence and talents of every kind rendered worthy of being the in- struments of divine providence to illustrate his church, main- tain its faith, and instruct all ranks of human society in all the duties of their respective stations. When I consider the length of preparation required to renew this race of men, my apprehensions is, that the friends of the Society will be too precipitate, too hasty in expecting benefits from it, before its pupils will be mature enough to produce them. I was sorry to notice, that you apprehend opposition in England to its existence there and of course in Ireland, notwithstanding the favorable disposition of the Irish Bishops. This commenda- tion of them and particularly of the M. Rev. Abp. of Dublin"", '22Ó American Catholic Historical Society was the more agreeable to me because [line and a half erased ] I always esteemed and thought him a real friend of the Society. Here I do not yet discover any sensation of hostility in our general, or any of the state governments. Little is said in the public papers of the event of the re-establishment. In conse- quence of the law, which was obtained above twenty years ago and had become necessary for securing our old estates to the purposes of religion, it will be our duty to observe the forms of the law, to subsist and quietly let the property pass into the hands of Trustees, who will all be members of the Society. Their vows and principles will direct them how, and by whom the estates must be administered for the services of the country and religion. You express a wish that all the old members should now return to the embraces of their beloved mother. Of thesel mentioned by you the good Mr. Pile has been dead nearly two years ago. I much doubt whether Mr. Ashton, whom I have not seen for several years, will be disposed to do so, or whether Mr. Grassi wishes it. Concerning Bp. Neale and myself, it seems to us that till more is known of the mind of our rulers, it might not be for the interests of our Breathren, even if his Holiness would allow us to vacate our Sees, to expose our concerns to Successors, unfriendly perhaps or liable to be ex- posed only to malicious misrepresentations. But this matter however has not yet received my full consideration. If you should learn thereafter that difficulties have arisen concerning the Society in this country, you may be assured that the open or surest authors of the opposition are certain foreign Eccles- iastics (not one of whom is of the respectable body, the Sul- picians) who after a hospitable reception and ample participa- tion of the prospect of our estates, proportioned to their ser- vices, took offense at every arrangement, preparatory to the now contemplated restitution of the property. Some of those persons would at once sell and divide it amongst the officiating clergy.66 ®6 S tony hurst Transcripts ,', 'Restoration of Jesuits in United States 227 Father Grassi unfortunately blundered at this juncture. In his excitement he allowed himself to be the spokesman for those who had been complaining for years of Carroll\'s attitude towards the restoration, and the result was an outspoken and indignant vindication of Carroll\'s policy from 1784 to 1814 : "" For my theology forbade me to allow, that pretended, or even acknowledge vivae vocis oracula were sufficient auth- ority to set aside the public, solemn acts of Pontifical juris- diction, wherever they had been proclaimed, admitted, and long submitted to. I therefore could not, as long as there was no public instrument from His Holiness, allowing the bishops to ordain titulo paupertatis religiosae, admit on that ground to Holy Orders those, who had associated themselves with the Society in Russia. Till such an instrument was issued, I think that the English VV. AA [Vicars- Apostolic], as well as the bishops in Ireland, were quite correct in refus- ing to ordain the pupils of Stonyhurst and Hodder House Titulo paup. & c. whatever my friend Mr. [Charles] Plowden may say, who on this point would not be supported by his Br [brother] Robert, the more solid divine of the two. Besides the matter of ordination, there were other points, on which my judgment was nowise satisfied, con- cerning those who became associated in this country to your Brethren in Russia. In foro externo , as the General him- self declared, they were not a religious body, they had no common interest, and they were not united in community, [but] only by the bonds of charity, being in the eye of ecclesiastical government no other than secular clergy; in a word, I saw nothing but contradiction between the estab- lished discipline of the Church, and the pretensions of Mr. Charles Neale, late Superior, some of his adherents and likewise those, which are sometimes asserted by Messrs. Beschter, Malevé, Malou, &c; but from which I can truly acquit you; though you have latterly discovered an impa- tience to be released from such restraints as were intro-', '228 American Catholic Historical Society duced through necessity, and cannot be removed otherwise than gradually, without irritating certain passions."" 67 No doubt Father Grassi, who had been strongly influenced by the Neales, resented the somewhat patrionizing tone of Carroll\'s letter after the receipt of the Sollicitudo, but cer- tainly the old and revered Archbishop - he was then in hisi eightieth year - might have been spared that attack upon his- honour.68 Father Kohlmann, as a foreigner, despite hisi great learning, would naturally take Grassi\'s side against the Americans. The incident might be allowed to pass un- noticed, but it has its place in the general scheme of eccle- siastical life at that day in the United States - domination by aliens. Archbishop Carroll could not bear anyone ill- will, and so it is not surprising to find no mention of Grassi\'st insinuations in his letters to Plowden around this time. He went on also with his project of issuing a Pastoral "" toi the congregations of my diocese on the subject of the re- storation of the Society/\' but he was being hindered, as he wrote to Grassi, on March 16, 1815, not "" through forget- fulness or indifference but truly and really for the want of time. There are now but few hours of the day during which my mind is fit for any serious application; and sci many urgent affairs have the first claim on those hours that you must have a little patience, as my desire is to make the address not absolutely unworthy of the occasion."" 69 67 Quoted by Hughes, I. c., pp. 851-852. 68 Father Thomas Hughes interprets Bishop Carroll\'s attitude to- wards the revival of the Society as a consequence of hisi sympathy with Plowden. ""This would indicate,"" Hugues writes, ""that Carroll was as far out of touch with the whole body of English Jesuits a$ the Nieale party considered he was out of sympathy with the American Jesuits."" This view fails to give a proper recognition between Car- roll\'s attitude before he became the appointed leader of the American\' Church and afterwards. As Superior and as Bishop it was his duty to avoid any suspicion that his actions were not in full accord with Propaganda\'s expressed decisions on this point. 69 Hughes, /. c., p. 853.', ""Restoration of Jesuits in United States 22 9 It is evident that deaith alone saved Carroll from the mis- ery of an open break with the Jesuit Superior; and while it was with no intimation of its dread approach, we can catch a glimpse of the man's soul in conflict with these annoyances; which robbed his last days of comfort. In one of his last letters to Plowden, dated June 25, 1815, he says: My dear and respected friend, My last was about one month ago ; it informed you of many of your letters having been received, nothwithstanding the im- pediments which for some years embarrassed our correspond- ence; tho, I regret the mis-carriage of others to which you refer. When I wrote, there was a pleasing expectation of a long and universal peace; but the late advices from France threaten to overwhelm again the world in trouble. For my own part, it shall be my endeavour, tho' I fear for my con- stancy, to keep my soul, as clear as I can, from those tumultu- ous sollicitudes which have agitated it so much for the losses and successes of contending nations. Such degrading im- morality, and such base treachery have blackened the histories of some of them, that an old man, expecially, sees the benefit of restraining all partialities and placing his entire reliance of the wisdom and providence of God. Yet there is one point, on which I feel, and in some degree cherish sollicitude, it is for the effect, which the irruption of Bonaparte into France, and consequent events may have on the progress of the newly restored Society. Your friend, Mr. Grassi is doing his best for it here, but it seems to me, that he consults chiefly, if not exclusively, foreignors, that is, his Brethren from Russia, Germany, Flanders, &c. all of them: good religious men, but not one of them possessing an ex- pansed mind, discerning enough to estimate difference between the American character, and that of the Countries which they left. Tho' I have noticed yet much of this partiality in him- self, yet I apprehend that dissatisfaction, complaint and per- haps remonstrance will arise against certain acts of his admin- istration. I shall advise, even in matters of the interior gov-"", '230 American Catholic Historical Society ernment of the Society whenever I can be useful, but if what has been noticed and reported hitherto is not mis-stated or mis- understood there is great reason that he will undesignedly be- get a jealousy on the part of the Secular Clergy in this Diocese and perhaps other Orders, against the Society, an evil, which I most earnestly deprecate and against which our old Brethren, who saved property here after dissolution, so peculiarly guarded.70 Father Grassi needed the letter referred to, which Arch- bishop Carroll wrote to him on February 21, 1815, and in which the venerable old man, wearied with the petty at- tacks upon his policies during the Interim, strikes back with all the vigor of his earlier days : .... I must do myself the justice to say that, if ever any measures were taken to organize a system for the preservation of the property, which formerly did, and now again does, be- long to the Society; to prevent it from being liable to waste and individual usurpation ; if the College over which you pre- side obtained existence and legal capacity to acquire property and receive donations ; if the very spot on which it stands, as well as the church, is now vested in the representatives of the College these were originally my acts alone; they were per- formed without the small [est] expense to those who have since enjoyed the property; my journeys year after year, my attendance on the general assemblies, my sollicitations, my care and watchfulness over the wording of the different acts of the Legislature, which were necessary to erect corporations for the clergy and the College, so that they might not be a bar against the Society in case of its revival ; these were done by me alone, tho I was very much opposed by those, who have since enjoyed the possession and administration of all which was acquired by them. The proofs of their opposition are still in my possession, and every one knows how they have profited by my exertions, labours, and expense. I think there- to Stonyhurst Transcripts .', ""Restoration of Jesuits in United States 231 fore that, contrary to my usual custom, I may claim to be, in an humble degree, de Societate bene meritus , as having protected those interests, which may by a prudent administration aid the progress of the body so miraculously restored. To which it may be added that, whilst all others were remaining with folded arms, without moving a step to prepare the way for a return of the Society, I alone opened and continued the correspond- ence with the General in Russia, and with his concurrence gave all that existence to it, which it could receive without a full and authentic repeal of the destructive brief of Clement XIV. I am ashamed for having said so much of myself, which nothing should have extorted from me but the undeserved insinuations of my unfriendliness for not adopting the suggestions of a zeal, which appeared to me so precipitate as to endanger the harmony of our fellow-labourers, to hurt the interests of the Society, and to embarrass my conscience as long as the Gan- ganellian brief remained unrepealed.71 Archbishop Carroll did not, however, allow Grassi' s sus- picions to change his admiration for the learned Italian Jesuit, who was Superior of the Society in the United States. But they undoubtedly differed on the property ques- tion which was Carroll's legacy to Archbishops Neale and Maréchal, and one fortunately that Dr. Carroll was never called upon to seittle definitively. After his death, the Grassi-Kohlmann view of the old Jesuit Estates began to prevail among the members of the restored Society and for many years clouded the good name of all who shared in the controversy. But this cloud soon passed, and the re- established Society in its complete canonical form - the only restoration that Dr. Carroll would consider sympathet- ically - began its great work of education in the Church here.72 All the difficulties and misunderstandings of the 71 Hughes, Z. c., part i, p. 375. 72 Even the apostate Jesuit Wharton rejoiced in the restoration of the Society.

Peter Guilday. bell (April 26, 1844), thiere is a quotation from Wharton\'s correspon- dence, dated February 14, 181 6, saying: ""You ask my opinion re- specting the restoration of the Order of Jesuits. \'I think it a great stroke of policy if not of justice in the Roman Pontiff. They were certainly the most enlightened and zealous champion© of his authority. But what is much more to their credit, they formed unquestionably the most learned and exemplary Body of Clergy in the Romai Church. They had the esprit de corps to a high degree; but in other respects a more disinterested and virtuous community never existed. Thiis is my testimony concerning them, and I know it is true.""

Twenty years ago this day, WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, for pro- mulgating the idea of immediate emancipation, was delivered from the murderous hands of a Boston mob, composed of ""gentlemen of property and standing,"" into Leverett Street Jail; and at this hour, PASSMORE WILLIAMSON endures martyrdom in Moyamensing Prison for his application of immediate emancipation to Jane Johnson and her two boys from her self-styled owner, John H. Wheeler. My reflections upon the two historical events of 1835 and 1855, induced my noting down the following reminiscences, hoping space may be found for them in your published report. I well remember the emphatically cloudy day, October 21, 1835, and the various scenes and incidents which characterised it, shroud- ing with indelible disgrace and infamy my native city. A friend of mine then boarded at a house in Boylston street, where, at the tea-table that evening, were assembled many Boston merchants. The Abolition Mob was the theme of conversation; and while a majority evinced their pro-slavery spirit by approving of what had occurred, two gentlemen warmly dissented,-one of whom, DAVID TILDEN, Esq., immediately became a subscriber to The Liberator, and so continued until his decease, a few years since. A sister of the coachman who so adroitly eluded the mob, and landed Mr. Garrison safely at the jail, often alluded to the impression made by that hour upon her brother. I have obtained the following facts from colored Anti-Slavery friends, whose feelings were deeply moved on the occasion. JOHN T. HILTON accompanied DAVID H. ELA (a printer in Cornhill, since deceased) to the meeting. They found the stairs impassable, in consequence of the crowd, and an altercation ensued. Mr. Ela was struck a severe blow by a man who rebuked him for upholding Abolitionists and ""niggers."" He resisted, until the parties were separated by the crowd rushing to seize Garrison in', 'DOCUMENTS 187 Wilson\'s Lane. The women came down the stairs amidst the hootings and insults of the mob. Two prominent men were engaged in tearing down the sign. Mr. Hilton heard a printer inform the mob where Garrison was secreted, in the rear of the building, where he (Mr. H.) went with the rest, to do what he could to rescue him, or, at all events, to be at his side. He saw Mr. Garrison dragged into State street, divested of coat and hat, and did not leave until Sheriff Parkman had him in the City Hall. JOHN BOYER VASHON, of Pittsburg, Pa., was an eye-witness to the terrible scene, which was heart-rending beyond his ability ever afterwards to express, as, of all living men, JOHN B. VASHON loved WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON most; and this feeling of affection con- tinued, for aught that is known, to the day of his death. When the mob passed along Washington street, shouting and yelling like madmen, the apprehensions of Mr. Vashon became fearfully aroused. Presently there approached a group which appeared even more infuriated than the rest, and he beheld, in the midst of this furious throng, Garrison himself, led on like a beast to the slaughter. He had been on the field of battle, had faced the cannon\'s mouth, seen its lightnings flash and heard its thunders roar, but such a sight as this was more than the old citizen soldier could bear, without giving vent to a flood of tears. The next day, the old soldier, who had helped to preserve his country\'s liberty on the plighted faith of security to his own, but who had lived to witness freedom of speech and of the press stricken down by mob violence, and life itself in jeopardy, because that liberty was asked for him and his, with spirits crushed and faltering hopes, called to administer a word of consolation to the bold and courageous young advocate of immediate and universal emancipation. Mr. Garrison subsequently thus referred to this circumstance in his paper:-"" On the day of that riot in Boston, he dined at my house, and the next morning called to see me in prison, bringing with him a new hat for me, in the place of one that was cut in pieces by the knives of men of property and standing."" Rev. JAMES E. CRAWFORD, now of Nantucket, boarded in Boston at the time of the mob, and, walking up State street, suddenly encountered the riotous multitude. On learning that Mr. Garrison was mobbed for words and deeds in behalf of the enslaved colored man, his heart and soul became fully dedicated to the cause of immediate emancipation. At a meeting of colored citizens, held in Boston, August 27th, 1855, on the subject of Equal School Rights, WILLIAM H. LOGAN', '188 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY alluded to his receiving from Sheriff Parkman, soon after the mob, a pair of pantaloons, (or the remnants thereof,) which had been torn from Mr. Garrison during the struggle. Mr. G. being present at the meeting, remarked, that, until that moment, he had never known what became of them. Imprisonment is a feature of martyrdom with which Abolitionists in the United States have become familiar, especially Mr. Garrison, who, at the bidding of slavery, was, in 1829, incarcerated in Balti- more. But these persecutions are to be accepted as jewels in their crown, as seals of their devotion to the cause of millions now in the prison-house of bondage. For whose speedy emancipation, I remain, Fraternally yours, WILLIAM C. NELL.30 A. STEWARD TO W. C. NELL DEAR SIR: We are glad to acknowledge your favor of October last, and to hear of your safe arrival in England, your health and fair prospects. Since my removal to Wilberforce, I have opened a school, which Mrs. Steward has engaged to teach for one year; while I shall probably devote my time to traveling through the States, for the benefit of the Colony, which is indeed poor, and in want of some assistance; and yet, not a dollar have we in the treasury to help them with. Mr. Paul has not returned, though we are daily expecting him. Our friends in New York, still have confidence in his pledge to do right; and we are anxiously expecting its fulfilment. Your wife, Mrs. Nell, and the children are well, and we are still doing all in our power for their comfort; but my means, in con- sequence of having been so much abroad the past season, are limited; by which you will see, my dear Sir, the necessity of remitting funds to me, that I may make your family more comfortable in all things, without distressing my own. The settlers are well, and are looking with hopeful expectancy for you to do something handsome for them, in which I do hope they may not be disappointed. Lewis is still in New York. We have appointed another agent, named Scott, but who is doing nothing for the Colony now. 30 Proceedings of the Anti-slavery Meeting held in Stacy Hall, Boston, on the Twentieth Anniversary of the Mob of October 21, 1835, pages 72-73.', 'DOCUMENTS 189 May the blessing of God rest upon you, and your endeavors; your good deportment put to silence your enemies; may they who foresee that you will cheat the poor colored children, be sadly mis- taken, and your good deeds finally enrol your name on the proud list of philanthropists, headed by a Wilberforce and a Clarkson. Yours, in great haste, AUSTIN STEWARD. WI3ERFORCEn, Dec., 1835. When the proslavery forces became aggressive there was much fear of kidnapping in the North as the following letter indicates: FROM DAVID RUGGLES MR. EDITOR: I have hesitated to call the public attention to the ""outrage"" alleged to have been committed on board the ""Brig Brilliante, on the night of the 24th inst.,"" to correct the false reports in relation to that outrage and myself, until now; when I trust, that the newspapers have ceased to abuse their mind in relation to it. It is a duty which I owe to them and myself, to state the facts in this, and in a subsequent outrage, so far as I am acquainted with them; and to pronounce the charges against me in the matter of ""riot "" or "" outrage "" or "" assault "" to be malicious and false. I have never visited that vessel at any time, except in open day, when humanity urged, and duty directed me. And the idea of my boarding a slave ship at night "" within the jurisdiction of the United States,"" in the port of New York; to release by force her captives from on board, when I have been acquainted with the fact for the last three months that there is a conspiracy on foot to kidnap and to sacrifice me upon the altar of slavery-need not be harbored for one moment in the minds of the most prejudiced. I will state a fact in another place, to show that the savage slave catchers who came with their pistols, dirks, and clubs, and handcuffs, and a gag to pounce upon me and drag me to the South, did not themselves believe the charge. That I aided in employing every legal and proper means in our courts of law, to let the slave go free, I admit, and shall endeavor to do so in every like suspicious case; but I sought not, I merit not the praise of releasing them-I left that duty to be performed, that laurel to be won by ""the proper authorities,"" whose duty it is to execute the laws of our country, which prohibits the ""bringing in, or importing African slaves into the jurisdiction of the United States', '190 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY from any foreign place, kingdom or country, in any manner whatever."" After being instructed in the fact that ""the proper authorities"" are willing to submit to the ""bringing in,"" and even to the importers holding such slaves in our city prison, until it might suit their con- venience to remove them on board the vessel, or (if he reserves his intent to sell) to the South-I held and still hold that that vessel ought to be libelled, and the case carried up to a higher tribunal; but since I am informed that the Portuguese who called at my office and stated the Brilliante belongs to the Governor or Mayor of Rio Jeneiro; that she is one of fifteen or twenty slavers which he employs in the slave trade; that he shipped to come to this port; she is to get an outfit to go to the coast of Africa for a cargo of slaves; and the one who informed me on a subsequent occasion, that the vessel returned from the coast with slaves a few weeks before they left Rio Janeiro; have not been seen on board the vessel for several days, I may not, in the absence of the proof to convict the captain and condemn the brig, proceed further; while at the same time I am satisfied that that vessel merits large suspicion. It is said ""that two of the slaves are liberated!"" I have to regret that they are not all liberated by the law, as much as I regret the reputed occasion was furnished by the friends of the poor emaciated victims, that the pro-slavery party could raise the cry ""Outrage!"" ""Negro riot!"" and ""Assault,"" to enlist the public sympathy in favor of De Souza, the oppressor, while he transports the oppressed to some southern slave market to be sold to the highest bidder! Money is scarce-men are the most valuable commodity that can be sent to the southern market; -they offer ""Two THOUSAND DOLLARS A HEAD for able bodied slaves"" in Florida. And according to the moral and political cancer, the Courier and Enquirer, of this morning, which professes to be acquainted with De Souza\'s financial affairs, and intimates that the lawyers have fleeced him very close-if this be true, it would, I think be unsafe to say that he has not taken the hint from the late decision in his own case, and reserved his intent, and sold them to the South. But let us return to the Savage Outrage.-On Wednesday morn- ing, 28th December, between one and two o\'clock, several notorious- slave-catchers made an attack upon the house in which I board, and attempted to force open the doors. I arose from my bed, and stepped to the door, and inquired, who\'s there? ""Is Mr. Ruggles in?"" ""Yes."" ""I wish to see you, sir."" ""Who are you."" ""A friend-David, open the door."" ""What is your name?"" ""Why-', 'DOCUTMENTS 191 why, it is Nash: I have come to see you on business of importance."" ""What\'s the matter?"" ""Nothing-I only wish to see you on some private business."" "" This is rather an unseasonable hour Mr. Nash, to settle private business; call in the morning at eight o\'clock."" ""Open this door or I will force it open."" ""It shall not be opened to-night, sir, unless you tell your errand."" ""Then I will get authority from High Constable Hays,"" [he retired, and soon returned] "" I have got authority from High Constable Hays to break open this door! Come on boys."" He forced open the door; he and others of his clan made a rush up to my room like hungry dogs; but finding that they had missed their victim, they commenced an assault upon the defenceless landlady; menaced her with clubs, pistols and dirks, that she might produce me. Mr. Joseph Michaels appeared, as the mate of the ""suspected slaver"" Brilliante, had his dagger raised to strike his sister, and bade him ""hold the blow, or I will strike you down!"" The assistance of the watch was called by them. Mr. M. was seized, and the handcuffs that Nash brought for me placed upon him, and he was dragged to the watch house, where I am informed Nash took from his cap a half sheet of paper, which he said was the writ that he had obtained from High Constable Hays to take me as a slave.-After disposing of M. Michaels, he and his clan returned to Lispenard street, in company with the watchman, and others who were disinterested. Nash said, ""had I have caught the fellow out the door, we would have fixed him."" ""Yes,"" said the savage Portuguese, brandishing his dirk, ""if he would not go, I would soon have put an end to his existence: he would never interfere with Brazilians again."" ""What did he do?"" ""Why,"" replied Nash, ""he went down on board the Brilliante and assaulted the captain."" ""How do you know it was him!"" Nash said, ""If he did not do it, some of the blacks did, and he is the ring leader among them."" Nash did not call to see me at 8 o\'clock in the morning; at 12 o\'clock, I proceeded to see him, or to make a statement of the facts in the case before the Mayor. As I entered the City Hall, I was pounced upon by Boudinot, who dragged me to the Police Office. I desired him not to drag me in that manner, and to show his authority to arrest me, because I would walk to the office with him-He refused to do so, and jammed me against one of the marble pillars-said he, ""I was after you last night!""', '192 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY When I appeared before the magistrate, he said that he under- stood that I had been engaged in a riot on board the brig Brilliante on the night of the 24th ult. and that I must find bail to appear before the Sessions to answer to the charge. My friend stepped out for my bail. Boudinot immediately dragged me to the city prison, and gave the jailor a paper, who said, ""I have no right to lock up, that is not a commitment."" ""Yes it is,"" said Boudinot, ""shut the fellow up!"" In less than 20 minutes, they had me on the way to Bellevue Prison. They said, ""we have got him now, he shall have no quar- ters, we will learn him to publish us as kidnappers!"" Now, whether these men did intend to take me from my bed and send me to the South with Waddy, the notorious southern slave catcher, who, I am informed, sailed for Savannah on Wednesday morning, or to ""put an end to my existence,"" if I resisted, I cannot say in the absence of proof; I hope they did not. But from their conduct, and from the manner in which, I am informed, Boudinot, Nash, John Lyon, and Waddy carried off Peter John Lee, from Rye -and from what I have understood, (for some two or three months past) they intended to do with me, I must confess, considering all the circumstances in the case, that I do believe that this was a desperate effort to execute their threats by sending me to the South. Nash is not a police officer, therefore the magistrate could not allow him a warrant to apprehend any one. Boudinot did not enter the house; he doubtless expected that I would attempt to escape in the street, that he might take me with the warrant, which he informed a gentleman he obtained from Governor Marcy in 1832 or \'33, by which he can arrest any colored person that Waddy may point out to him named ""Jesse,"" ""Abraham,"" ""Peter,"" or ""Silvia,"" and send him or her South, without taking such person before a magis- trate, as they did Peter John Lee. Now, I thank Heaven that I am still permitted to live, and take fresh courage in warning my endangered brethren against a gang of kidnappers, which continues to infest our city and the country, to kidnap men, women and children, and carry them to the South. While Boudinot holds a warrant, by which he says he has been sending colored people to the South, for the last three years, and with which he boasts that he can ""arrest and send any black to the South""-no man, no woman, no child is safe. Our houses may be broken open at night by northern or southern and Portuguese slave catchers; we may be assaulted and threatened', 'DOCUMENTS 193 with clubs, pistols or dirks, and handcuffed and gagged, and carried away to the South, while HUMANITY and JUSTICE continue to sleep! Most affectionately and diligently yours, in the cause of Human Freedom, DAVID RUGGLES. New York, Jan. 4th, 1836.11 This letter shows the feeling of the fugitive with respect to his people whom he had left in bondage. TO MY FATHER, MOTHER, BROTHERS, AND SISTERS32 DEARLY BELOVED IN BONDS, About seventeen long years have now rolled away, since in the Providence of Almighty God, I left your embraces, and set out upon a daring adventure in search of freedom. Since that time, I have felt most severely the loss of the sun and moon and eleven stars from my social sky. Many, many a thick cloud of anguish has pressed my brow and sent deep down into my soul the bitter waters of sorrow in consequence. And you have doubtless had your troubles and anxious seasons also about your fugitive star. I have learned that some of you have been sold, and again taken back by Colonel . How many of you are living and together, I cannot tell. My great grief is, lest you should have suffered this or some additional punishment on account of my Exodus. I indulge the hope that it will afford you some consolation to know that your son and brother is yet alive. That God has dealt wonderfully and kindly with me in all my way. He has made me a Christian, and a Christian Minister, and thus I have drawn my support and comfort from that blessed Saviour, who came to preach good tidings unto the meek, to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound. To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God: to comfort all that mourn. To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified. 31 First Annual Report of the New York Committee of Vigilance for the year 1837, pp. 73-77. 32 This letter was written in 1844.', '194 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY If the course I took in leaving a condition which had become intolerable to me, has been made the occasion of making that condi- tion worse to you in any way, I do most heartily regret such a change for the worse on your part. As I have no means, however, of knowing if such be the fact, so I have no means of making atone- ment, but by sincere prayer to Almighty God in your behalf, and also by taking this method of offering to you these consolations of the gospel to which I have just referred, and which I have found to be pre-eminently my own stay and support. My dear father and mother; I have very often wished, while administering the Holy Ordinance of Baptism to some scores of children brought forward by doting parents, that I could see you with yours among the num- ber. And you, my brothers and sisters, while teaching hundreds of children and youths in schools over which I have been placed, what unspeakable delight I should have had in having you among the number; you may all judge of my feeling for these past years, when while preaching from Sabbath to Sabbath to congregations, I have not been so fortunate as even to see father, mother, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, or cousin in my congregations. While visiting the sick, going to the house of mourning, and burying the dead, I have been a constant mourner for you. My sorrow has been that I know you are not in possession of those hallowed means of grace. I am thankful to you for those mild and gentle traits of character which you took such care to enforce upon me in my youthful days. As an evidence that I prize both you and them, I may say that at the age of thirty-seven, I find them as valuable as any lessons I have learned, nor am I ashamed to let it be known to the world, that I am the son of a bond man and a bond woman. Let me urge upon you the fundamental truths of the Gospel of the Son of God. Let repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ have their perfect work in you, I beseech you. Do not be prejudiced against the gospel because it may be seemingly twisted into a support of slavery. The gospel rightly understood, taught, received, felt and practised, is anti-slavery as it is anti-sin. Just so far and so fast as the true spirit of the gospel obtains in the land, and especially in the lives of the oppressed, will the spirit of slavery sicken and become powerless like the serpent with his head pressed beneath the fresh leaves of the prickly ash of the forest. There is not a solitary decree of the immaculate God that has been concerned in the ordination of slavery, nor does any possible development of his holy will sanctify it.', 'DOCUMENTS 195 He has permitted us to be enslaved according to the invention of wicked men, instigated by the devil, with intention to bring good out of the evil, but He does not, He cannot approve of it. He has no need to approve of it, even on account of the good which He will bring out of it, for He could have brought about that very good in some other way. God is never straitened; He is never at a loss for means to work. Could He not have made this a great and wealthy nation without making its riches to consist in our blood, bones, and souls? And could He not also have given the gospel to us without making us slaves? My friends, let us then, in our afflictions, embrace and hold fast the gospel. The gospel is the fulness of God. We have the glorious and total weight of God\'s moral character in our side of the scale. The wonderful purple stream which flowed for the healing of the nations, has a branch for us. Nay, is Christ divided? ""The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to (for) all men, teach- ing us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.""-Titus ii. 11-14. But you say you have not the privilege of hearing of this gospel of which I speak. I know it; and this is my great grief. But you shall have it; I will send it to you by my humble prayer; I can do it; I will beg our heavenly Father, and he will preach this gospel to you in his holy providence. You, dear father and mother cannot have much longer to live in this troublesome and oppressive world; you cannot bear the yoke much longer. And as you approach another world, how desirable it is that you should have the prospect of a different destiny from what you have been called to endure in this world during a long life. But it is the gospel that sets before you the hope of such a blessed rest as is spoken of in the word of God, Job iii. 17, 19. ""There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary be at rest; there the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressors. The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master."" Father, I know that thy eyes are dim with age and weary with weeping, but look, dear father, yet a little while toward that haven.', '196 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY Look unto Jesus, ""the author and finisher of thy faith,"" for the moment of thy happy deliverance is at hand. Mother, dear mother, I know, I feel, mother, the pangs of thy bleeding heart, that thou has endured, during so many years of vexation. Thy agonies are by a genuine son-like sympathy mine; I will, I must, I do share daily in those agonies of thine. But I sincerely hope that with me you bear your agonies to Christ who carries our sorrows. 0 come then with me, my beloved family, of weary heart-broken and care-worn ones, to Jesus Christ, ""casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.""-2 Peter v. 7. With these words of earnest exhortation, joined with fervent prayer to God that He may smooth your rugged way, lighten your burden, and give a happy issue out of all your troubles, I must bid you adieu. Your son and brother, JAS. P. Alias J. W. C. PENNINGTON. TO COLONEL F - T , OF H- , WASHINGTON COUNTY, MD. 1844. DEAR SIR, It is now, as you are aware, about seventeen years since I left your house and service, at the age of twenty. Up to that time, I was, according to your rule and claim, your slave. Till the age of seven years, I was, of course, of little or no service to you. At that age, however, you hired me out, and for three years I earned my support; at the age of ten years, you took me to your place again, and in a short time after you put me to work at the blacksmith\'s trade, at which, together with the carpentering trade, &c., I served you peaceably until the day I left you with exception of the short time you had sold me to S- H -, Esq., for seven hundred dollars. It is important for me to say to you, that I have no con- sciousness of having done you any wrong. I called you master when I was with you from the mere force of circumstances; but I never regarded you as my master. The nature which God gave me did not allow me to believe that you had any more right to me than I had to you, and that was just none at all. And from an early age, I had intentions to free myself from your claim. I never consulted any one about it; I had no advisers or instigators; I kept my own counsel entirely concealed in my own bosom. I never meditated', 'DOCUMENTS 197 any evil to your person or property, but I regarded you as my oppressor, and I deemed it my duty to get out of your hands by peaceable means. I was always obedient to your commands. I laboured for you diligently at all times. I acted with fidelity in any matter which you entrusted me. As you sometimes saw fit to entrust me with considerable money, to buy tools or materials, not a cent was ever coveted or kept. During the time I served you in the capacity of blacksmith, your materials were used economically, your work was done expe- ditiously, and in the very best style, a style second to no smith in your neighbourhood. In short, sir, you know well that my habits from early life were advantageous to you. Drinking, gambling, fighting, &c., were not my habits. On Sabbaths, holidays, &c., I was frequently at your service, when not even your body-servant was at home. Times and times again, I have gone on Sunday afternoon to H- , six miles, after your letters and papers, when it was as much my privilege to be ""out of the way,"" as it was C - But what treatment did you see fit to return me for all this? You, in the most unfeeling manner, abused my father for no cause but speaking a word to you, as a man would speak to his fellow-man, for the sake simply of a better understanding. You vexed my mother, and because she, as a tender mother would do, showed solicitude for the virtue of her daughters, you threatened her in an insulting brutal manner. You abused my brother and sister without cause, and in like manner you did to myself; you surmised evil against me. You struck me with your walking-cane, called me insulting names, threatened me, swore at me, and became more and more wrathy in your conduct, and at the time I quitted your place, I had good reason to believe that you were meditating serious evil against me. Since I have been out of your hands, I have been signally favoured of God, when I infer that in leaving you, I acted strictly in accordance with his holy will. I have a conscience void of offence towards God and towards all men, yourself not excepted. And I verily believe that I have performed a sacred duty to God and my- self, and a kindness to you, in taking the blood of my soul peaceably off your soul. And now, dear sir, having spoken somewhat point- edly, I would, to convince you of my perfect good will towards you, in the most kind and respectful terms remind you of your', '198 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY coming destiny. You are now over seventy years of age,pressing on to eternity with the weight of these seventy years upon you. Is not this enough without the blood of some half-score of souls? You are aware that your right to property in man is now dis- puted by the civilized world. You are fully aware, also, that the question, whether the Bible sanctions slavery, hag distinctly divided this nation in sentiment. On the side of Biblical Anti-slavery, we have many of the most learned, wise and holy men in the land. If the Bible affords no sanction to slavery, (and I claim that it can- not,) then it must be a sin of the deepest dye; and can you, sir, think to go to God in hope with a sin of such magnitude upon your soul? But admitting that the question is yet doubtful, (which I do only for the sake of argument,) still, sir, you will have the critical hazard of this doubt pressing, in no very doubtful way, upon your declining years, as you descend the long and tedious hill of life. Would it not seem to be exceedingly undesirable to close an eventful probation of seventy or eighty years and leave your reputation among posterity suspended upon so doubtful an issue? But what, my dear sir, is a reputation among posterity, who are but worms, compared with a destiny in the world of spirits? And it is in light of that destiny that I would now have you look at this subject. You and I, and all that you claim as your slaves, are in a state of probation; our great business is to serve God under His righteous moral government. Master and slave are the subjects of that government, bound by its immutable requirements, and liable to its sanctions in the next world, though enjoying its for- bearance in this. You will pardon me then for pressing this point in earnest good faith. You should, at this stage, review your life without political bias, or adherence to long cherished prejudices, and remember that you are soon to meet those whom you have held, and do hold in slavery, at the awful bar of the impartial Judge of all who doeth right. Then what will become of your own doubtful claims? What will be done with those doubts that agitated your mind years ago; will you answer for threatening, swearing, and using the cowhide among your slaves? What will become of those long groans and unsatisfied com- plaints of your slaves, for vexing them with insulting words, placing them in the power of dogish and abusive overseers, or under your stripling, misguided, hot-headed son, to drive and whip at pleasure, and for selling parts or whole families to Georgia? They will all', ""DOCUMENTS 199 meet you at that bar. Uncle James True, Charles Cooper, Aunt Jenny, and the native Africans; Jeremiah, London, and Donmore, have already gone a-head, and only wait your arrival-Sir, I shall meet you there. The account between us for the first twenty years of my life, will have a definite character upon which one or the other will be able to make out a case. Upon such a review as this, sir, you will, I am quite sure, see the need of seriousness. I assure you that the thought of meeting you in eternity and before the dread tribunal of God, with a com- plaint in my mouth against you, is to me of most weighty and solemn character. And you will see that the circumstances from which this thought arises are of equal moment to yourself. Can the pride of leaving your children possessed of long slave states, or the policy of sustaining in the state the institution of slavery, justify you in overlooking a point of moment to your future happiness? What excuse could you offer at the bar of God, favoured as you have been with the benefits of a refined education, and through a long life with the gospel of love, should you, when arraigned there, find that you have, all your life long, laboured under a great mistake in regard to slavery, and that in this mistake you had died, and only lifted up your eyes in the light of eternity to be corrected, when it was too late to be corrected in any other way. I could wish to address you (being bred, born, and raised in your family) as a father in Israel, or as an elder brother in Christ, but I cannot; mockery is a sin. I can only say then, dear sir, farewell, till I meet you at the bar of God, where Jesus, who died for us, will judge between us. Now his blood can wash out our stain, break down the middle wall of partition, and reconcile us not only to God but to each other, then the word of his mouth, the sentence will set us at one. As for myself, I am quite ready to meet you face to face at the bar of God. I have done you no wrong; I have nothing to fear when we both fall into the hands of the just God. I beseech you, dear sir, to look well and consider this matter soundly. In yonder world you can have no slaves-you can be no man's master-you can neither sell, buy, or whip, or drive. Are you then, by sustaining the relation of a slaveholder, forming a character to dwell with God in peace? With kind regards, I am, sir, yours respectfully, J. W. C. PENNINGTON.33 33 The Fugitive Blacksmith, 74-84."", '200 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY This letter was taken from the paper mentioned herein and published with the following comment: "" We cut the above from the N. Y. Evangelist, an abolition paper, with no other views than to show how colored people get along in the free city of New York. Mr. Pennington is a man of color, formerly from this State, has received the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from some European Institution, and is a man of unquestioned ability. As he intimates, he is denied admission to public vehicles on account of his color, only. He says he rides with the white people side by side in European cities, but is only denied the privilege in New York. Why then settle in New York? He is not a native of that city, no ties of birth or early association retain him there. He says his predecessor in that ministerial charge was brought to an early grave by these very hardships which he has voluntarily offered to undergo. Then why accept the charge, and why complain after accepting? The fact is, the home for such men as Dr. Pennington, is not New York City, nor any city on the American Continent. Broad fertile Africa is the true home of the black man. It is enough for him to control the destiny of the most valuable quarter of the globe. He can never conquer this land or the prejudices, if he chooses so to call them, of its inhabitants."" MR. EDITOR:-You are aware that I am pastor of the Presby- terian church on the corner of Prince and Marion streets, in this city. My congregation extends from No. 1 Pearl street to 65th street, and from Hoboken to Brooklyn and Williamsburg; so that in the discharge of my pastoral duties, I am constantly called to different points, and from one extremity to the other of this immense field. And yet, sir, according to usage in this community, I cannot avail myself of the use of any of the lines of omnibuses, or any of the multiplying lines of railways in the city. I will state two, out of many facts, to show how severely the thing works. On the morning of our last Thanksgiving day, I went to Newtown, L. I., and held service, with the intention of being back in season for the 3 o\'clock service at my own church in Prince street. I returned to the city, making my time comfortably till I got to Grand street Ferry, on Williamsburg side, where', 'DOCUMENTS 201 missing by two steps the boat, I saw that time would fail me on this side unless I took an omnibus. I got over the ferry 20 minutes to 3 o\'clock, just as a Grant street omnibus was starting, and which would pass Marion street, within two blocks of my church, in 15 minutes. I attempted to get in, but was rudely refused, and having to walk fully a mile and a quarter, I arrived long after the hour of public service, and in a very uncomfortable state, both physically and mentally, for my work. At the early part of our recent warm season, a worthy female member of my church, who was a teacher in the Colored Orphan Asylum, on the Fifth Avenue near Fortieth street, died, and I was notified to attend her funeral. The funeral was appointed for one o\'clock-I heard of it about twelve. I was in the lower part of the city, visiting, at the time. I went at once to my residence, No. 50 Laurens street, changed, and started for the Asylum. Now, could I have had a \'bus, I could have got there in ample time for the services at 1 o\'clock. On the block above my house is a carriage stand, where I stopped and attempted to negotiate for a hack, but $1.50 was the lowest cent I could get one for, to go the distance! So in painful excitement I walked the entire distance, under the burning sun of one of our hottest days, getting there after the hour and not fit for service. Sir, these cases I could multiply, but it is not necessary. You have an illustration of the working of the usage, and of its most oppressive influence. And why is it that a man in the public service of one of the largest congregations in the city, has to submit to such a system of oppression? It is not because I smoke segars in the \'busses, as I see some white men do. It is not because I chew and spit tobacco in the \'busses, as some white men do. It is not because I carry a great pet dog with me, and say to every one ""If you love me you love my dog""-not excepting finely dressed ladies in the \'busses. But it is simply and only because I am a black man, obediently carrying about on my person the same skin, with the same color, which the Almighty has seen fit to give me. In this matter of the color of a man, ""he that reproacheth the Almighty, let him answer it."" I do not. But seriously, Mr. Editor, it is a hard case that a man should be compelled, in the public service, to walk ounce after ounce of his heart\'s best blood out of him every day, and not be allowed to avail himself of the public conveyances designed to save time, health and life. It is known to impartial witnesses that my predecessor, Rev.', '202 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY Theo. S. Wright, though one of the most valued ministers that ever lived in this city, had his life shortened several years by this op- pressive usage; and I feel that I am walking in his footsteps. Have I a right thus knowingly to dig for myself an untimely grave? Has the New York public a right to require at my hands this unreason- able amount of exposure? I shall be told that the majority of the public will object to my riding in the \'busses. Is that true? Will the members of a Chris- tian public object to me, a minister of Christ, using the facilities of a public conveyance, while about my Master\'s business? Besides, hundreds of the persons who now ride in our stages, are the same with whom I have rode in the \'busses at London, Liverpool, Glasgow, Edinburg, Brussels, Paris, &c. I only mention this, to show the inconsistency of this usage. I ask for simple justice at the hands of my countrymen. J. W. PENNINGTON.\'0 WILLIAM W. FINDLAY TO THE COLORED PEOPLE OF INDIANA ""DEAR FRIENDS,-The writer being a colored man, it may be supposed that he desires the well-being of his race, not of a part of the colored race, but of the whole race of Africans, in this land and in Africa. Nor do I consider myself guilty of affectation, when I say, that I ardently desire their elevation, and am willing to contribute all I can to that end. It has long been an inquiry with me, how can our race be elevated? How can colored men be made truly independent? After much anxious and painful inquiry, I have concluded, that to be truly independent, we must enjoy rights and privileges as broad and as liberal as those enjoyed by the white citizen of the United States; in other words, have the right of electing our law-makers and our magistrates; and all the offices of state should be accessible to our color; and not only so, but we should be free to move in such circles of society as we may be entitled to by our moral worth, character, and talents; and likewise, free to form alliance with those classes of society. These, in my humble opinion, are the rights and privileges we must possess before we can be independent. ""But now let us inquire in candor, do we as a people enjoy such independence? Do colored men, in the most liberal of the northern states, enjoy such independence? You all know that they do not. 10 African Repository, XXIX, 82-85.', 'DOCUMENTS 203 The sad reverse is the case. And will the time soon come, in the history of American society, when the colored man will be permitted to enjoy such independence-independence, not only in civil things, but independence in all the more delicate matters of social equality? I must honestly confess, I think not. And further: I am bold to confess, that any thing short of the above-described independence will not satisfy me; nor should any thing short satisfy the man of an independent spirit. ""But such independence we can not obtain in the United States; therefore, I will seek it outside the United States. I will seek it where I know I can find it, and that is in the republic of Liberia, which is the only Christian republic where the colored man can find a quiet and secure home. Nor do I act dishonorably, in thus escaping from civil and social oppression; for I am only doing what thousands of the first and best settlers in the United States did; and I think it an honor to follow their example, in seeking liberty, though, like them, I be compelled to seek it in a wilderness. And the object of this appeal is, to invite you who love true independence, and are willing to endure some toil to obtain it, to go with us to that land of liberty, where we may likewise aid in the elevation and enlightenment of our whole race, which duty is more obligatory or us than upon the white race, many of whom are willing to sacrifice their lives and property in the work of converting Africa. ""Some of you may blame us for not staying in this land and contending for all the above rights of man. Our answer to all such complaints is this: we believe that civil slavery in this land will be abolished by divine Providence without the co-operation of the free colored man; he requires not our aid in this work-he can and will in his own way, sweep slavery from the civil institutions of America. But I honestly doubt whether it is the will or order of Providence to grant us perfect social equality with the white race at this time, nor am I disposed to strive or quarrel with them for this favor, but would follow the example of Abraham, who disliked the strife that had sprung up between him and Lot, and religiously proposed separation as a remedy for the quarrel, and a means of perpetuating peace; so we should separate from the white race, that we may be free and they enjoy peace; for, doubtless, God has given this land to them. Acting from the above religious and honorable views, we confidently expect that God will bless us in our movements. "" It- is the design of the writer and some of his friends, to go out to Liberia about the month of October or November next, and it is', '204 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY desirable to have as many emigrants from Indiana as we can muster. Liberia holds out many attractions for the man of color, but the greatest is that of liberty and independence. Thousands have gone from this land to that, and all who have been industrious have done well; many of them are becoming wealthy, but what is best, they are all free! Come, let us go and cast our lot in with them and be free likewise. If any of you have been cherishing the spirit of independence, and long for such freedom as the free republic of Liberia offers, and if you desire a passage to that land, just let your wishes be known to the Agent of the American Colonization Society of this state. Address Rev. J. Mitchell, at Indianapolis, who will be pleased to book your name as an emigrant, and procure for you a passage out, and send you all the information you may want. No time should be lost. Act now-act for yourselves, your children, and your race. ""WM. W. FINDLAY.34 ""Covington, Ia., April 6, 1849."" Rev. SAMUEL MAY, JR., General Agent Mass. A. S. Society.

Now he is one of the best writers and ablest speakers in our country. REV. SAML. J. MAY Following the principles laid down and practiced by Pestelozzi, Owen, and the father of General Armstrong, Douglass here antedates Booker T. Washington as a bold advocate of industrial education: ROCHESTER, March 8, 1853 MY DEAR MRS. STOWE: You kindly informed me, when at your house a fortnight ago, that you designed to do something which would permanently con- tribute to the improvement and elevation of the free coloured people in the United States. You especially expressed interest in such of this class as had become free by their own exertions, and desired most of all to be of service to them. In what manner and by what means you can assist this class most successfully, is the subject upon which you have done me the honour to ask my opinion. . . I assert then that poverty, ignorance and degradation are the combined evils; or in other words, these constitute the social disease of the free coloured people of the United States. To deliver them from this triple malady, is to improve and elevate them, by which I mean, simply to put them on an equal footing with their white fellow countrymen in the sacred right to ""Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" I am for no fancied or artificial elevation, but only ask fair play. How shall this be obtained? I answer, first, not by establishing for our use high schools and colleges. Such institutions are, in my judgment, beyond our immediate occasions and are not adapted to our present most pressing wants. High schools and colleges are excellent institu- tions, and will in due season be greatly subservient to our progress; but they are the result, as well as they are the demand of a point of progress, which we as a people have not yet attained. Accus- tomed as we have been, to the rougher and harder modes of living, and of gaining a livelihood, we cannot, and we ought not to hope that in a single leap from our low condition, we can reach that of Minister, Lawyers, Doctors, Editors, Merchants, etc. These will doubtless be attained by us; but this will only be, when we have patiently and laboriously, and I may add, successfully, mastered', '206 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY and passed through the intermediate gradations of agriculture and the mechanical arts. Besides, there are-and perhaps this is a better reason for my view of this case-numerous institutions of learning in this country, already thrown open to coloured youth. To my thinking, there are quite as many facilities now afforded to the coloured people, as they can spare the time from the sterner duties of life, to avail themselves of. In their present condition of poverty, they cannot spare their sons and daughters two or three years at boarding-schools or colleges, to say nothing of finding the means to sustain them while at such institutions. I take it, there- fore, that we are well provided for in this respect; and that it may be fairly inferred from the fact, that the facilities for our education, so far as schools and colleges in the Free States are concerned, will increase quite in proportion with our future wants. Colleges have been open to coloured youth in this country during the last dozen years. Yet few comparatively, have acquired a classical education; and even this few have found themselves educated far above a living condition, there being no methods by which they could turn their learning to account. Several of this latter class have entered the ministry; but you need not be told that an educated people is needed to sustain an educated ministry. There must be a certain amount of cultivation among the people to sustain such a ministry. At present we have not that cultivation amongst us; and therefore, we value in the preacher, strong lungs, rather than high learning. I do not say, that educated ministers are not needed amongst us, far from it! I wish there were more of them! but to increase their number, is not the largest benefit you can bestow upon us. We have two or three coloured lawyers in this country; and I rejoice in the fact; for it affords very gratifying evidence of our progress. Yet it must be confessed, that in point of success, our lawyers are as great failures as our ministers. White people will not employ them to the obvious embarrassment of their causes, and the blacks, taking their cue from the whites, have not sufficient confidence in their abilities to employ them. Hence educated coloured men, among the coloured people, are at a very great discount. It would seem that education and emigration go together with us, for as soon as a man rises amongst us, capable, by his genius and learning, to do us great service, just so soon he finds that he can serve himself better by going elsewhere. In proof of this, I', 'DOCUMENTS 207 might instance the Russwurms, the Garnets, the Wards, the Crummells and others, all men of superior ability and attainments, and capable of removing mountains of prejudice against their race, by their simple presence in the country; but these gentlemen, finding themselves embarrassed here by the peculiar disadvantages to which I have referred, disadvantages in part growing out of their education, being repelled by ignorance on the one hand, and prej- udice on the other, and having no taste to continue a contest against such odds, they have sought more congenial climes, where they can live more peaceable and quiet lives. I regret their election, but I cannot blame them; for with an equal amount of education and the hard lot which was theirs, I might follow their example. There is little reason to hope that any considerable number of the free coloured people will ever be induced to leave this country, even if such a thing were desirable. This black man-unlike the Indian-loves civilization. He does not make very great progress in civilization himself but he likes to be in the midst of it, and prefers to share its most galling evils, to encountering barbarism. Then the love of the country, the dread of isolation, the lack of adventurous spirit, and the thought of seeming to desert their ""brethren in bonds,"" are a powerful check upon all schemes of colonization, which look to the removal of the coloured people, without the slaves. The truth is, dear madam, we are here, and here we are likely to remain. Individuals emigrate-nations never. We have grown up with this republic, and I see nothing in her character, or even in the character of the American people as yet, which compels the belief that we must leave the United States. If then, we are to remain here, the question for the wise and good is precisely that you have submitted to me-namely: What can be done to improve the condition of the free people of colour in the United States? The plan which I humbly submit in answer to this inquiry-and in the hope that it may find favour with you, and with the many friends of humanity who honour, love, and cooperate with you-is the establishment in Rochester, N. Y., or in some other part of the United States equally favourable to such an enterprise, of an INDUSTRIAL COLLEGE in which shall be taught several im- portant branches of the mechanical arts. This college to be opened to coloured youth. I will pass over the details of such an institution as I propose. . .. Never having had a day\'s schooling in all my life I may not be expected to map out the details of a plan so com-', ""208 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY prehensive as that involved in the idea of a college. I repeat, then, I leave the organisation and administration to the superior wisdom of yourself and the friends who second your noble efforts. The argument in favour of an Industrial College-a college to be conducted by the best men-and the best workmen which the mechanical arts can afford; a college where coloured youth can be instructed to use their hands, as well as their heads; where they can be put into possession of the means of getting a living whether their lot in after life may be cast among civilized or uncivilized men; whether they choose to stay here, or prefer to return to the land of their fathers-is briefly this: Prejudice against the free coloured people in the United States has shown itself nowhere so invincible as among mechanics. The farmer and the professional man cherish no feeling so bitter as that cherished by these. The latter would starve us out of the country entirely. At this moment I can more easily get my son into a lawyer's office to learn law than I can into a blacksmith's shop to blow the bellows and to wield the sledge- hammer. Denied the means of learning useful trades we are pressed into the narrowest limits to obtain a livelihood. In times past we have been the hewers of wood and the drawers of water for American society, and we once enjoyed a monopoly in menial enjoyments, but this is so no longer. Even these enjoyments are rapidly passing away out of our hands. The fact is-every day begins with the lesson, and ends with the lesson--that coloured men must learn trades; and must find new employment; new modes of usefulness to society, or that they must decay under the pressing wants to which their condition is rapidly bringing them. We must become mechanics; we must build as well as live in houses; we must make as well as use furniture; we must construct bridges as well as pass over them, before we can properly live or be respected by our fellow men. We need mechanics as well as ministers. We need workers in iron, clay, and leather. We have orators, authors, and other professional men, but these reach only a certain class, and get respect for our race in certain select circles. To live here as we ought we must fasten ourselves to our country- men through their every day cardinal wants. We must not only be able to black boots, but to make them. At present we are un- known in the Northern States as mechanics. We give no proof of genius or skill at the county, State, or national fairs. We are unknown at any of the great exhibitions of the industry of our fellow-citizens, and being unknown we are unconsidered."", ""DOCUMENTS 209 The fact that we make no show of our ability is held conclusive of our inability to make any, hence all the indifference and con- tempt with which incapacity is regarded, fall upon us, and that too, when we have had no means of disproving the infamous opinion of our natural inferiority. I have during the last dozen years denied before the Americans that we are an inferior race; but this has been done by arguments based upon admitted principles rather than by the presentation of facts. Now, firmly believing, as I do, that there are skill, invention, power, industry, and real mechanical genius, among the coloured people, which will bear favourable testimony for them, and which only need the means to develop them, I am decidedly in favour of the establishment of such a college as I have mentioned. The benefits of such an institution would not be confined to the Northern States, nor to the free coloured people. They would extend over the whole Union. The slave not less than the freeman would be benefited by such an institution. It must be confessed that the most powerful arguments now use by the Southern slaveholder, and the one most soothing to his conscience, is that derived from the low condition of the free coloured people of the North. I have long felt that too little attention has been given by our truest friends in this country to removing this stumbling block7out of the way of the slave's liberation. The most telling, the most killing refutation of slavery, is the presentation of an industrious, enterprising, thrifty, and intelligent free black population. Such a population I believe would rise in the Northern States under the fostering care of such a college as that supposed. To show that we are capable of becoming mechanics I might adduce any amount of testimony; but dear madam, I need not ring the changes on such a proposition. There is no question in the mind of any unprejudiced person that the negro is capable of making a good mechanic. Indeed, even those who cherish the bitterest feel- ings towards us have admitted that the apprehension that negroes might be employed in their stead, dictated the policy of excluding them from trades altogether. But I will not dwell upon this point as I fear I have already trespassed too long upon your precious time, and written more than I ought to expect you to read. Allow me to say in conclusion, that I believe every intelligent coloured man in America will approve and rejoice at the establish- ment of some such institution as that now suggested. There are many respectable coloured men, fathers of large families, having"", '210 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY boys nearly grown up, whose minds are tossed by day and by night with the anxious enquiry, ""what shall I do with my boys?"" Such an institution would meet the wants of such persons. Then, too, the establishment of such an institution would be in character with the eminently practical philanthropy of your trans-Atlantic friends. America could scarcely object to it as an attempt to agitate the public mind on the subject of slavery, or to dissolve the Union. It could not be tortured into a cause for hard words by the American people, but the noble and good of all classes would see in the effort an excellent motive, a benevolent object, temperately, wisely, and practically manifested. Wishing, you, dear madam, renewed health, a pleasant passage, and safe return to your native land. I am most truly, your grateful friend, FREDERICK DOUGLASS.36 The following letter of Anthony Burns, extradited as a fugitive slave, then in Boston, offers further opportunity for the study of the man about whom there was so much con- temporary comment: ANTHONY BURNS TO THE BAPTIST CHURCH AT UNION, FAUQUIER CO., VIRGINIA ""IN answer to my request by mail, under date July 13, 1855, for a letter of dismission in fellowship and of recom- mendation to another church, I have received a copy of the Front Royal Gazette, dated Nov. 8, 1855, in which I find a communication addressed to myself and signed by John Clark, as pastor of your body, covering your official action upon my request, as follows: "" THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST, AT UNION, FAUQUIER CO., VIRGINIA. ""To all whom it may concern: WHEREAS, Anthony Burns, a member of this church, has made application to us, by a letter to our pastor, for a letter of dismission, in fellowship, in order that he may unite with another church of the same faith and order; and whereas, it has been satisfactorily 36 John Lobb, Life and Times of Frederick Douglass (London, 1882), pp. 248- 252.', 'DOCUMENTS 211 established before us, that the said Anthony Burns absconded from the service of his master, and refused to return voluntarily-thereby disobeying both the laws of God and man; although he subsequently obtained his freedom by purchase, yet we have now to consider him only as a fugitive from labor (as he was before his arrest and restoration to his master), have therefore ""Resolved, Unanimously, that he be excommunicated from the communion and fellowship of this church. ""Done by order of the church, in regular church meeting, this twentieth day of October, 1855. ""WM. W. WEST, Clerk."" Thus you have excommunicated me, on the charge of ""dis- obeying both the laws of God and men,"" ""in absconding from the service of my master, and refusing to return voluntarily."" I admit that I left my master (so called), and refused to return; but I deny that in this I disobeyed either the law of God, or any real law of men. Look at my case. I was stolen and made a slave as soon as I was born. No man had any right to steal me. That manstealer who stole me trampled on my dearest rights. He committed an outrage on the law of God; therefore his manstealing gave him no right in me, and laid me under no obligation to be his slave. God made me a man-not a slave; and gave me the same right to myself that he gave the man who stole me to himself. The great wrongs he has done me, in stealing me and making me a slave, in compelling me to work for him many years without wages, and in holding me as merchandize,-these wrongs could never put me under obliga- tion to stay with him, or to return voluntarily, when once escaped. You charge me that, in escaping, I disobeyed God\'s law. No, indeed! That law which God wrote on the table of my heart, inspiring the love of freedom, and impelling me to seek it at every hazard, I obeyed, and, by the good hand of my God upon me, I walked out of the house of bondage. I disobeyed no law of God revealed in the Bible. I read in Paul (1 Cor. 7: 21), ""But, if thou mayest be made free, use it rather."" I read in Moses (Deut. 23: 15, 16), ""Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee. He shall dwell with thee, even among you in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best; thou shalt not oppress him."" This implies my right to flee if I feel myself op-', '212 JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY pressed, and debars any man from delivering me again to my pro- fessed master. I said I was stolen. God\'s Word declares, ""He that stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death."" (Ex. 21: 16.) Why did you not execute God\'s law on the man who stole me from my mother\'s arms? How is it that you trample down God\'s law against the oppressor, and wrest it to condemn me, the innocent and oppressed? Have you forgotten that the New Testament classes ""manstealers"" with ""murderers of fathers"" and ""murderers of mothers,"" with ""manslayers and whoremongers?"" (1 Tim. 1:9, 10.) The advice you volunteered to send me, along with this sentence of excommunication, exhorts me, when I shall come to preach like Paul, to send every runaway home to his master, as he did Onesimus to Philemon. Yes, indeed I would, if you would let me. I should love to send them back as he did, "" NOT NOW AS A SERVANT, but above a servant: -A BROTHER-a brother beloved-both in the flesh and in the Lord;"" both a brother-man, and a brother-Christian. Such a relation would be delightful-to be put on a level, in position, with Paul himself. ""If thou count me, therefore, a partner, receive him as myself."" I would to God that every fugitive had the privi- lege of returning to such a condition-to the embrace of such a Christianity-""not now as a servant, but above a servant,""-a ""partner,"" -even as Paul himself was to Philemon! You charge me with disobeying the laws of men. I utterly deny that those things which outrage all right are laws. To be real laws, they must be founded in equity. You have thrust me out of your church fellowship. So be it. You can do no more. You cannot exclude me from heaven; you cannot hinder my daily fellowship with God. You have used your liberty of speech freely in exhorting and rebuking me. You are aware that I too am now where I may think for myself, and can use great freedom of speech, too, if I please. I shall therefore be only returning the favor of your exhortation if I exhort you to study carefully the golden rule, which reads, ""All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets."" Would you like to be stolen, and then sold? and then worked without wages? and forbidden to read the Bible? and be torn from your wife and children? and then, if you were able to', 'DOCUMENTS 213 make yourself free, and should, as Paul said, ""use it rather,"" would you think it quite right to be cast out of the church for this? If it were done, so wickedly, would you be afraid God would indorse it? Suppose you were to put your soul in my soul\'s stead; how would you read the law of love?

Moreover, had he at that time or any other, given me in good faith the sum named as belonging to the Settle- ment, (believing that as we were laboring together, for the interest of one common cause, the board would not hesitate to allow it,) he would certainly have demanded a receipt, which it would have pleased me to give, of course, that he might satisfy the board that their liberality had been disbursed according to their wishes, or his judgment. But receiving no money from your agent, will be a sufficient reason for not acknowledging it, or giving due credit to the Settlement. I can account for this charge on his part, in no way, except that as he was with me a part of the time I was in London, and we traveled together a part of the time, during which, he ably and effectively assisted me in exposing that most iniquitous combination, ""The American Colonization Society,""-he charged to me, (that is, to my mission) sundry items of expense which he undoubtedly believed justly incurred by his helping me to open the eyes of British philanthropists to the real design of that society; and I shall ever remember with gratitude, his heartiness and zeal in the cause and in my behalf. I owe much to the success that so signally crowned my mission, to his presence, testimony, and eloquent denunciation of the colonization scheme. I, however, received no money from him, and can but think that the above explanation was the occasion of his making the charge, and which I trust will leave on his memory, no intentional wrong. WM. L. GARRISON BOSTON, MASS., June 1856.39 n Garrison, of course, like many other white friends, gave the Negroes what- ever advice and assistance he could.']",12750,3843,1,"[-0.03539324179291725,
