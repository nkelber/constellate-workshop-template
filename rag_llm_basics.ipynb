    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we've explored the basics of Large Language Models, interacted with an LLM using the OpenAI API, and analyzed its performance on various literary analysis tasks. We've seen both the impressive capabilities and some limitations of current LLM technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lesson, we'll dive into embeddings and introduce the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance LLM performance.\n",
