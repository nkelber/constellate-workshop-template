    "1. Implement a cross-encoder reranking method using a pre-trained model from the `sentence-transformers` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Develop a method to dynamically adjust the number of retrieved documents based on the complexity of the query.\n",

    "3. Implement a simple caching mechanism to store and reuse embeddings and retrieved results for frequently asked questions.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final lesson of our LLMs with RAG workshop, we've explored advanced techniques for optimizing Retrieval Augmented Generation systems. We've implemented efficient retrieval using FAISS, developed strategies for handling long contexts, created optimized prompts, and built a reranking method. Finally, we combined these techniques into a comprehensive RAG pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "These optimization techniques can significantly enhance the performance of RAG systems, making them more accurate, efficient, and capable of handling complex queries and large knowledge bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you continue to work with RAG systems, remember that ongoing experimentation and refinement are key to achieving the best results for your specific use case.\n",
